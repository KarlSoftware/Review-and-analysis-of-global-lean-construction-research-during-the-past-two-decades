AB  - Liquefied natural gas projects are complex and full of variability. Their plan reliability is affected by constraints arising from engineering, supply chains and construction site. Effective management of these constraints is critical to reducing project uncertainties and improve workflow. However, current approaches for constraint removal are fragmented and heavily rely on human’s commitments because the underlying data for decision-making are static and outdated. In order to tackle this problem, this paper proposes a framework of total constraint management (TCM), which consists of three main parts: constraint modelling, constraint monitoring and constraint removal. Information technologies (i.e. building information modelling, radio frequency identification, barcoding, laser scanning and photogrammetry) are also discussed and incorporated into the TCM framework so as to make it more practical and effective. A laboratory-based experiment was developed to demonstrate and evaluate the framework. The results showed that successful implementation of TCM could significantly improve construction workflow and productivity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In order to effectively meet the new requirements raised by the international shipbuilding convention and specification for shipbuilding enterprises, and to quickly improve enterprise innovation capability, this article analyzes the modern shipbuilding characteristics and compares them with the lean production methodology. In China, the shipbuilding enterprise development is guided by the Shipbuilding Industry Standard Conditions assessment rules from the Ministry of Industrial and Information Technology of China. This article proposes establishing an efficient merchant shipbuilding system based on the lean production methodology and the construction technology capability indices in the Shipbuilding Industry Standard Conditions. This article focuses more on the hull construction and merchant ship production processes, instead of the entire engineering, procurement, and construction shipbuilding management. It elaborates key system technologies including value stream analysis, efficient shipbuilding production design, efficient shipbuilding project management, efficient shipbuilding precision management, and efficient full factory management. The efficient shipbuilding system has been implemented in a Chinese merchant shipbuilding enterprise to significantly improve productivity and reduce shipbuilding cycle time.

AB  - The underlying theory of symbolic time series analysis (STSA) has led to the development of signal representation tools in the paradigm of dynamic data-driven application systems (DDDAS), where time series of sensor signals are partitioned to obtain symbol strings that, in turn, lead to the construction of probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA). Although various methods for construction of PFSA from symbol strings have been reported in literature, similar efforts have not been expended on identification of an appropriate alphabet size for partitioning of time series, so that the symbol strings can be optimally or suboptimally generated in a specified sense. The paper addresses this critical issue and proposes an information-theoretic procedure for partitioning of time series to extract low-dimensional features, where the key idea is suboptimal identification of boundary locations of the partitioning segments via maximization of the mutual information between the state probability vector of PFSA and the members of the pattern classes. Robustness of the symbolization process has also been addressed. The proposed alphabet size selection and time series partitioning algorithm have been validated by two examples. The first example addresses parameter identification in a simulated Duffing system with sinusoidal input excitation. The second example is built upon an ensemble of time series of chemiluminescence data to predict lean blowout (LBO) phenomena in a laboratory-scale swirl-stabilized combustor apparatus.

AB  - Off-site construction is a unique hybrid of manufacturing operations and on-site construction activities. Maximizing the production output has long been the main challenge for off-site manufacturers. Among other responses to this challenge, the use of multi-task shared resources has proved its effectiveness in improving tangible performance measures of production. However, multi-skilled resources often become bottlenecks (overloaded) when producing multiple classes of products and prevent the production network from meeting due dates. This paper analytically models the problem of defining the optimal product sequencing using optimization-based metaheuristics with the aim of minimizing changeover time, which is wasted switching from a product class to another. Production data of two Australian off-site manufacturers are used in the subsequent empirical analysis resulting in advancement of five research propositions. This research contributes to the scheduling theory by expanding the insight into dynamics of resource sharing and job sequencing. The developed models and propositions are of practical value for off-site manufacturers of building elements to maximize their production output. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Office-related processes in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry represent a parallel system that works to support activities performed by those in the field, however, researchers often overlook its management. A method to collect and analyze data about submittals was developed using a case study approach, and two cases are presented illustrating an overview of these processes and the use of lean construction concepts to categorize activities and times associated with their different steps. One of the cases sheds light on the reality of how submittals and requests for information (RFIs) are managed in construction projects and indicates that only about a fifth of the submittals in a project are approved as submitted, whereas less than half of them need additional work to be finalized, and over a third need to be revised entirely before they can be accepted and distributed. Opportunities for improvement abound in the management of construction documents and they involve changes/more transparency in the processes used to manage the documents and the need to define indicators to evaluate their performance. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The Lean Construction Institute’s (LCI) goal is to develop and deploy a new way of thinking about and practicing project management. Projects are conceived as temporary production systems, to be designed in light of the relevant ‘physics’ of the task to be accomplished. It is claimed that complex, quick, and uncertain projects cannot be managed in traditional ways. Detailed CPM schedules, after-the-fact tracking, earned value analysis, and competitive bidding are inadequate to the challenge of today’s dynamic projects. There are four roots of this Lean Construction approach: success of the Toyota Production System, dissatisfaction with project performance, efforts to establish project management on a theoretical foundation, and the discovery of facts anomalous (impossible to explain) from the perspective of traditional thinking and practice. The last of these four is explored in this paper, which presents the current state of construction management thinking as one of conflict between competing paradigms. © 2004 Lean Construction Journal.

AB  - Lean production theory, as a production management tool, describes a system that delivers a finished product free from defects, to a customer in zero time, and with nothing left in inventory. Recently, the concepts of lean production have been introduced to construction yet have generally been rejected. Lean construction concepts were recently tested in a simulation environment and were found to be effective. To facilitate the implementation of the concepts of lean production in construction simulation, and subsequently within an actual construction project, a generic approach has been created and is presented in this paper. A special purpose simulation (SPS) template was developed for surface works operations in road construction as an example application. The template provides a means of testing the concepts of lean production on road construction simulation models to quantify their impact on road construction processes. This general approach for implementing lean production theory in construction simulation modeling also proved capable of directing the process of optimizing simulation models. © 2004 Lean Construction Journal.

AB  - This paper is written in the light of the papers for the 12th annual conference in the International Group for Lean Construction. It tries to establish a brief overview of the development over the past twelve years and to establish the state of the art. From this its primary objective is to open a discussion of the future effort within the Lean Construction environment. The paper proposes that a change in the underlying paradigm is happening and that a new research agenda should be established with an outset in the lean understanding of the construction process as it is known from the construction sites and with a complex systems understanding of the nature of this process. Elements in this agenda are outlined and areas for research identified within the areas of maximizing value for the client, minimizing waste in delivering this value, and managing the project delivery. © Lean Construction Journal 2004.

AB  - Lean Thinking is currently often positioned as the underlying theory of lean production among practitioners and academics, although its originators, Womack and Jones, seem not to have presented it as a theory. This paper endeavours to analyze whether Lean Thinking can be viewed as a theory of lean production. For this purpose, a critical assessment of Lean Thinking is carried out. Lean Thinking is argued to lack an adequate conceptualization of production, which has led to imprecise concepts, such as the term “value”. The five principles of Lean Thinking do not systematically cover value generation, and they do not always encapsulate the core topics in their respective areas. The failure to trace the origin of lean concepts and principles reduces the opportunity to justify and explain them. Despite claims for generality, the application area of the five lean principles is limited to the transformation of mass production, with, for instance, one-of-a-kind production and construction being largely out of scope. It is concluded that it is opportune to move on beyond Lean Thinking, towards a generic theory of production, for acquiring a solid foundation for designing, operating and improving production systems. © Lean Construction Journal 2004.

AB  - The notion of production flow is not well understood in the context of construction. A coherent, consistent theoretical model of flow would have practical value as it would support development of better approaches to managing production within and across projects and of measures of flow quality needed to implement them. A literature review and analysis of existing conceptualizations of flow in manufacturing and in construction lead to formulation of a model of construction flow that has three interrelated but distinct axes: project portfolio, process and operations flows. A tentative set of ideal conditions for good flow was formulated with regard to each of these three primary flows. The review, the summary model and the set of conditions provide a basis for further research and development of a comprehensive model of flow in construction and a definition of what constitutes good flow. © 2016, Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Inefficient logistic management can expose the project to the construction waste and eventually can effects the project performance. Just in time (JIT) is excellent in managing the construction logistic and achieving the project’s goal by eliminating waste. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge and addressing the logistical issues in IBS and integrating lean construction to tackle that particular issue. The literature review has been conducted through relevant database. It was found that there is a need for more holistic approaches to be adopted in JIT implementation in Industrialized Building System (IBS) project. IBS were well known for the cost saving benefit that can be derived from the implementation of the system, but logistical problem during the performance of the project can affected the profit of the project which later may consume the benefit of cost reduction made on site. Suggestion on how JIT can contribute for improving the construction logistic management process in order to enhance IBS uptake in Malaysian construction projects will be concluded. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive literature review that seeks to address modern factors worldwide that are associated with the selection of current procurement methods. The aim is to develop an up-to-date multi-attribute procurement decision-making chart for selecting the appropriate method for the project. Design/methodology/approach – Stage 1 (literature review). The search engines, Emerald; Business Source Premier; Science Direct and Sage were selected to identify journals that have published the most procurement methods-related articles. The search covered the period 1980-2015. Stage 2 (Survey) – after analyzing and appraising the literature, an up-to-date utility decision-making chart for selecting the appropriate procurement method for the project was developed. The chart was based on findings from a survey that included 57 construction professionals and who have demonstrated sound experience about the various procurement options. Findings – There is no one best procurement method for all projects. The selection depends on the nature of the issues or problem at hand. Decision making is not a punctual act. It is often a complex process. Effective decision making also demands quality and timely information, and a careful consideration of alternatives. The multi-attribute decision-making chart presented in this paper has included modern criteria and the client would have end up with different recommendations and consequences should these criteria were not included in priority weightings. Practical implications – The literature review provides states-of-the art research in the field of procurement methods in construction and the multi-attribute chart is intended to offer decision makers an opportunity to broaden their horizon on the different alternatives procurement routs that could lead to different consequences. Originality/value – To the best of the authors’ knowledge, very few publications have discussed modern selection criteria for procurement methods in construction under one study. Therefore, this paper has established a platform for scholars and researchers to obtain more useful insights into procurement methods concerns. It has identified research trends in procurement methods which may allow industrial practitioners to appreciate the key concerns in their development of modern concepts and principles such as supply chain, lean construction, sustainability, innovation, value engineering, e-procurement and Building information modeling. The inclusion of these modern criteria will present and add value to procurement decision makers within the construction industry. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Electrical contracting firms have consistently pursued industrializing their business through the implementation of prefabrication, lean production, and supply chain integration. Despite the pioneering prefabrication efforts of electrical contractors, there is still no clear understanding of the determinants of electrical prefabrication feasibility in terms of supply chain collaboration and surrounding industry requirements. Accordingly, this paper presents the development of prediction models of prefabrication feasibility for electrical contractors. The research tasks of this study were performed in three main phases. The first phase included various data collection tasks, including conducting semistructured interviews, providing an online questionnaire, and obtaining relevant local economic data of the respondents' metropolitan areas. The second phase involved the utilization of the collected questionnaire responses and economic data to develop logistic regression models that relate the prefabrication feasibility to its statistically significant determinants. The third phase involved validating the developed models by assessing their prediction accuracy and performing extensive sensitivity analysis of their determinants. The findings of this study should prove useful to electrical contractors who need to obtain data-driven assessment of prefabrication feasibility considering their business attributes and surrounding industry parameters. This study presents the two main contributions to the study field of construction prefabrication. First, prefabrication feasibility was found to be significantly dependent on four industry-related determinants: regional economic growth, industry competition, labor cost rate, and worker union resistance. Second, prefabrication feasibility was found to be significantly dependent on two main internal firm-related determinants: building information modeling capability and supply coordination with vendors. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This paper discusses a novel approach for resource-based scheduling that builds upon existing analytical models to achieve practical allocation of resources that are constrained by supply and demand. The approach facilitates workface planning to allocate work to individual craft persons. The main contribution of the work is advancement of the current scheduling practice of workface planning by (1) generalizing the resource supply-demand matching problem (RSDMP); and (2) formalizing the RSDMP scheduling approach for planning resource workflows which consists of (a) the mathematical model, (b) a two-stage optimization approach, and (c) innovative use of a resource-activity interaction table. The result is an optimum resource-constrained schedule providing the shortest project duration with the leanest resource supply. The optimum resource requirement is identified between the lower and upper bounds of the resource supply limit, thus ensuring the site's spatial and safety requirements. The optimum resource workflows of individual craft persons are presented to facilitate the project execution at the workface level. To illustrate the approach, an example adapted from a classic textbook is used. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a practical level, an oil refinery turnaround project including input data and relevant information prepared for workface planning is used. As a result of the RSDMP analysis, the optimum plan obtained is resource-loaded, practically feasible, and workface executable. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Background: This paper will suggest that combined strategy of Lean Construction techniques with Linear Programming as a possible solution to the problem of overruns in construction work. It will seek to examine how a combination of Lean Construction techniques and a base software model of Linear Programming can apply to a construction project at the initial and intermediate planning stage to overcome challenges related to project overruns. Based on a literature review and data collection it will investigate if the combination of Lean Construction techniques and Linear Programming could result in time and cost assurances in a construction project. Objective: To investigate to what extent a combination strategy of Lean Construction principles and Linear Programming could help solve the problem of overruns in time and costs in construction. Analysis: The research work deals with the application of lean construction principles such as Last planner system Just in time etc. at the first part of the project and then the second part introduces formation of linear programming model base on the output of first part. The collective result of the combination is then measured. Expected Findings: Time and Cost overrun can be easily overcome through applying the combination of Lean construction techniques, and linear programming was implemented. Project planning and scheduling can be improved in the early phase of the project, which helps to avoid delays and failure of project occurring at a later stage. Improvement: The combination of both is never used in the construction industry so far, so this project gives initial strategy to do so for small scale construction project first, and after successful implementation, it can be applied to the large scale construction project.

AB  - Traditionally, production control on construction sites has been challenging, and still remains challenging. The ad-hoc production control methods that are usually used, most of which are informal, foster uncertainty that prevents smooth production flow. Lean construction methods such as the Last Planner System have partially tackled this problem by involving site teams into the decision making process and having them report back to the production management system. However, such systems have relatively long "lookahead" planning cycles to respond to the dynamic production requirements of construction, where daily, if not hourly control is needed. New solutions have been proposed such as VisiLean, KanBIM, etc., but again these types of construction management systems require the proximity and availability of computer devices to workers. Through this paper, the authors investigate how the communication framework underlying such construction management systems can be further improved so as to fully or partially automate various communication functions across the construction project lifecycle (e.g., to enable lean and close to real-time reporting of production control information). To this end, the present paper provides evidences of how the Internet of Things (IoT) and related standards can contribute to such an improvement. The paper then provides first insights - through various construction scenarios - into how the proposed communication framework can be beneficial for various actors and core business perspectives, from lean construction management to the management of the entire building lifecycle. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Inefficiency stands as a major problem in construction industry. Lean thinking is a relatively new process improvement philosophy which approaches inefficiency by reducing the waste. Although the inefficiency of design stages has been associated with the poor results of construction projects, less attention has been paid on the relationship between lean thinking and architectural design process. While there is a strong potential for improvement in the design processes via application of lean thinking, an analysis of waste items has never been done. Thus, this study aims to identify, categorize, and rank the waste items in architectural design sector. In the first stage of the study 28 design waste items were identified and classified under 8 lean production waste categories as a result of semistructured interviews conducted with senior architects performing in Ankara, Turkey. In the second stage, a questionnaire was executed over a larger population of architects to examine the "frequency of occurrence", "impact over cost", "impact over duration", and "impact over quality" for each design waste item. The findings were statistically analysed and an evaluation of risk was completed. The statistical analysis of the questionnaires shows that there is a shared understanding of impacts of waste items over architectural design processes, with strong statistical evidence over their validity. The results of the study can be utilized for the strategical implementation of lean production philosophy in architectural design process.

AB  - Background/Objectives: The unbiased of this study is to assess the application of lean construction of construction firms and give eminence grade model to construction enterprises. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Wastage in the construction companies has been subject of several research projects around the world in recent years. It is commonly recognized that very high level of waste exists in construction companies. Lean Construction considers construction wastes as prospective wastes that obstruct flow of value to the user and should be eliminated or avoided. The creation of this waste can be eliminated or prevented by applying lean construction principles. The data for this study will be gathered through a detailed questionnaire survey. The target population for the data collection is project managers of building construction organizations. The questionnaires consist of major factors that influencing the implementation of lean construction. By knowing the major factors gives better understanding in allocating them to parties/stake holders involved. Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) was employed to analyze data. Findings: As a result, the execution level of construction companies in order to the use of lean construction was acquired, to check how it was implicit and in what way its principles were realistic. After this, the results were determined and suggestions stood through to the concerns to help them contrivance Lean Thinking. Application/Improvements: This study results are used for Construction Industries.

AB  - As a way to minimize the waste of materials, time and effort to generate the maximum value, the lean construction concept has been introduced successfully into the construction industry. This paper first examines the implementation of the lean construction principles, which is primarily focusing on waste reduction. The paper then suggests the adoption of a process-based approach to integrate the lean principles into the off-site prefabricated housing production. A case study on Hong Kong public housing production is presented in this paper. The study analyses the detailed business process along the supply chain of public housing production, which typically includes the design, manufacturing of prefabricated components, cross-border logistics, as well as on-site assembly and operation. Observations are made on the existing procedural deficiencies from the perspective of the client In order to further improve the efficiency and increase the cooperation among various supply chain actors, information communication technologies are implemented by the client based on the process-based approach. ©2016 IAHS.

AB  - Purpose: Price fairness is important amongst construction and engineering consultants because a perceived lack of it engenders unwillingness to pay amongst clients. This can create contractual disputes that negatively impact upon a consultant’s ability to generate sufficient revenue to ensure business continuity and survival. With this in mind, this research aims to analyse the pricing measurement forces needed to attain pricing fairness within a Ghanaian construction cost consultancy practice. Specific objectives are to identify the key variables responsible for price fairness within cost consultant services and to establish any interrelationships between them. Design/methodology/approach: This study leans towards the positivist methodological tradition by adopting a quantitative approach. A survey questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 79 construction cost consultancies, drawn from a population of 372, who were registered with the Ghana Institution of Surveyors. Hypotheses developed from the literature review were then tested on data collected. Findings: The analysis revealed that fairness of construction cost consultancy services pricing is significantly related to value and affordability, pricing objectives, pricing strategies, taxes and international trade and its effects on inputs for construction cost consultancy services. Originality/value: The paper advances knowledge by providing a basis for the consideration of pricing forces in the valuing of construction cost consultancy services which hitherto has not been the case. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Compared to the manufacturing industry, Lean Six Sigma (LSS) lacks a clear methodology for its application in the tertiary service. One reason is the difficulties to assess information flow compared to physical flow. Indeed, the use of information flow as a process entry in the LSS method is not well investigated, mainly due to the difficulties in collecting adequate and sufficient data. The purpose of this research study is to investigate the application of LSS in the tertiary service, in particular, real estate development. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on an action research methodology where LSS methodology is applied to solve client-dissatisfaction issue. One of its main causes is found to be the late delivery time. The work describes how the method was applied. Findings: LSS is an adequate approach for making well-thought-out improvement in real estate development. Practical implications: The work provides an implementation of LSS in real estate development. It also gives new insights into the LSS application in the tertiary service. The work also suggests practical recommendations and solutions to address the main challenges faced by real estate development. Originality/value: Construction is governed by many processes that are difficult to identify and, even more, to assess. LSS helps identifying those which create real value for the client. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Indian Construction projects suffer from cost and time overruns which leads to wastage and productivity problems that directly affect overall industry's profitability and economy. Today's economically developed nations also face these problems. As a result, researches and methodologies have been developed to reduce the risk of overruns and improve project outcomes. A number of these methods are based upon Lean production principles that focus on identifying value, eliminating wastage and creating a smooth flow of materials, information and work. Slow adaption of these Lean concepts by contractors has also been noticed from the past decade. This principle has been found to improve the reliability of project delivery in complex construction environments. However, implementation of this technique is being a great challenge as it requires technical expertise as well as lots of paper works behind. This paper focus mainly on incorporating traditional management system followed with Lean construction thereby developing a simplified lean implementation framework and recording format to measure daily performance occurred and required in construction projects. By effectively utilizing these data, various analyses generating value adding reports and information for continual improvement of the project shall be achieved. Proper investigation of these reports and finding out the root cause would facilitate construction projects to be free from time and cost overrun. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - Projects have been considered as temporary based production systems which need to be designed, produced and delivered within a specified time. It has been asserted by a number of researchers that fast, complex and uncertain projects cannot be managed through the conventional ways and that fast track projects with long, complicated supply chains involving many players and subject to multiple, extensive process design changes have complex flow management that have failed miserably. The conceptual models of construction management and the tools it utilizes (work breakdown structure, critical path method, and earned value management) have been criticized to be deficient in handling the present unique challenges of projects. As a result, the industry is characterized by a number of wastes including: Overproduction, lead time, transportation, inappropriate processing, inventories, unnecessary movements, rework and making do wastes. There is therefore the need for practical and robust models and techniques that will help projects teams deal with the issues of wastes in projects. This can only be achieved through the adoption of lean production systems in the construction industry, thus, Lean Construction (LC). In this paper, LC approach and the importance for its implementation has been discussed as the robust approach for project management. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - Safety as well as productivity performance in construction is often poor due to congested site conditions. We lack a formalized approach in effective activity-level construction planning to avoid workspace congestion. The purpose of this research is to investigate and prototype a new Building Information Modeling (BIM) enabled approach for activity-level construction site planning that can pro-actively improve construction safety. The presented method establishes automated workspace visualization in BIM, using remote sensing and workspace modeling technologies as an integral part of construction safety planning. Global Positioning System (GPS) data loggers were attached to the hardhats of a work crew constructing cast-in-place concrete columns. Novel algorithms were developed for extracting activity-specific workspace parameters from the recorded workforce location tracking data. Workspaces were finally visualized on a BIM platform for detecting potential workspace conflicts among the other competing work crews or between material lifting equipment. The developed method can support project stakeholders, such as engineers, planners, construction managers, foremen and site supervisors and workers with the identification and visualization of the required or potentially congested workspaces. Therefore, it improves the foundation on how decisions are made related to construction site safety as well as its potential impact on a productive and unobstructed work environment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The National Health Service (NHS) in England has a capital budget of approximately £4bn per year to spend on the construction and refurbishment of new and existing buildings. The majority of capital costs are committed by early stage design decisions, which have a large impact on operations, costs and performance. It is necessary to incorporate a sociotechnical approach to design as healthcare is a service environment in which patients are part of the system. The design of facilities determines the allocation of space and the interacting flows including: patients, clinicians, visitors, medication, supplies, equipment, and information. The design requires many trade-offs and has a major impact on the patient experience and the quality and efficiency of care. This paper evaluates the application of the Lean 3P (production, preparation, process) participative design method as part of a pilot project to design a new endoscopy unit at Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust. The research, which was funded by the Health Foundation, used participant observation, and an analysis of the layout drawings and the 7 flows of medicine to appraise 3P. The existing and proposed designs were compared. The results show that 3P is an effective tool that can develop designs that meet the requirements of multiple stakeholders. A framework was developed that positions 3P within the overall design process. The seven flows of medicine classification was extended to include subcategories and to identify interrelationships between the flows. This will help inform the design of healthcare facilities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: An important avenue toward a proper ‘energy transition’ through regional and local projects is for government to collaborate with private sector organizations. In the energy sector, these latter organizations are often already involved in private-private partnerships for collaboration toward energy transition. This article focuses on the energy governance question whether in fact some of these forms of collaboration actually are about public governance, as they effectively lean on government involvement. This seems to be the case in the construction of biogas infrastructures for the production and distribution of green gas. This contribution discusses, on the basis of the case ‘Biogas grid Noordoost Fryslân’, if such collaboration should in fact be labeled as public-private partnership (PPP). In the energy governance discourse, this issue is important because in the organization of PPP, the public interest of energy transition comes with specific normative safeguards, originating in public law. Methods: This article provides a legal normative assessment on the basis of a specific case, the Biogas grid Noordoost Fryslân. The relevant empirical data on this case is gathered by a document study, including research reports, policy plans, project documents, and by interviews. Experts from the Dutch energy sector were face-to-face interviewed by a semi-structured questionnaire. The analysis uses the concept of PPP in relation to public authority. Results: On the basis of a confrontation between the results from literature and from the results of empirical case study of a biogas grid in the Dutch region Noordoost Fryslân, we conclude that governmental influence can take a ‘disguised’ form by ‘quasi’ private organizations, with major normative consequences for the mode of sustainable energy governance. Conclusions: Administrative law in particular poses (binding) criteria for safeguarding public interests, such as on transparency, relevant also to the mode of governance applied in the promotion of renewable energy. Public standards for governance of renewable energy projects have to be sufficiently safeguarded, as regards their form and content of steering, while at the same time retaining the advantages, which ensue from private party involvement within PPP. © 2015, Heldeweg et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - Lean principles provide improvement to the efficiency of construction by synchronizing the process of building and eliminating waste, which in turn can have a positive impact on the environment. This is generating a growing interest in linking the relationship between lean and low carbon. The authors compare the carbon emission in the truss construction process of a steel structured building in China optimized by lean principles with the original process. A partial life cycle assessment (LCA) framework is used to calculate the embodied carbon of materials, energy consumption of transportation from cradle to site, energy consumption of construction equipment and disposal of construction waste. This confirms through case study and measurement what had previously been proposed and adds the aspect of site efficiency into the current method for life cycle assessment of carbon emission. The results show that the lean process had an embodied carbon of 5532.1t CO2e delivering a reduction of 43t compared to the original process, demonstrating lean interventions can have a positive impact on the environment. This study establishes the link between the efficiency of the construction process and low carbon using empirical evidence demonstrating that contractors can use lean principles in their construction processes to improve efficiency and reduce carbon emissions as a result. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Purpose: – The purpose of this paper is to propose a leagile transformation model for product development that guides manufacturers in the construction of a road map and the management of its deployment in line with both lean and agile improvement objectives. Design/methodology/approach: – An intervention qualitative and transformative research approach was adopted in order to develop required knowledge to theorise professional practice made from rigorous observations of facts. The research project took place over a period of two and a half years, in partnership with an international firm that develops and produces a wide range of luxury products. Findings: – The application of the methodology proved that a lean transformation does not have to be generated only by the field needs but it can follow a mixed approach where a top-down transformation management linked with strategic objectives is deployed without compromising implication and needs from people on the field. The right balance can be found between the strategic aspect of transformation and the incremental aspect on the field of lean paradigms. Research limitations/implications: – For complete validation and widespread scientific application, the model should be tested in other sectors and industries. Practical implications: – The application case of the leagile model in several divisions of a luxury organisation proved that the proposed approach can be used as a guide for manufacturer in the construction of an improvement road map and in the management of its deployment. The application cases enabled a number of positive results to be generated and measured on quantitative indicators such as service ratio for new products for which, one of the divisions saw an increase of 30 per cent. The approach created a positive revolution among development team members by its potential in terms of communication, steering, benchmarking and knowledge system. Originality/value: – The model supports the identification and prioritisation of improvement initiatives by focusing on the levers for improvement that meet the needs and objectives of transformation, as well as the organisation’s maturity level. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The aims of the present study were analyze the fatigue process at distinct intensity efforts and to investigate its occurrence as interactions at distinct body changes during exercise, using complex network models. For this, participants were submitted to four different running intensities until exhaustion, accomplished in a non-motorized treadmill using a tethered system. The intensities were selected according to critical power model. Mechanical (force, peak power, mean power, velocity and work) and physiological related parameters (heart rate, blood lactate, time until peak blood lactate concentration (lactate time), lean mass, anaerobic and aerobic capacities) and IPAQ score were obtained during exercises and it was used to construction of four complex network models. Such models have both, theoretical and mathematical value, and enables us to perceive new insights that go beyond conventional analysis. From these, we ranked the influences of each node at the fatigue process. Our results shows that nodes, links and network metrics are sensibility according to increase of efforts intensities, been the velocity a key factor to exercise maintenance at models/intensities 1 and 2 (higher time efforts) and force and power at models 3 and 4, highlighting mechanical variables in the exhaustion occurrence and even training prescription applications.

AB  - Overcoming the financial barriers to energy-efficiency (EE) investments requires efforts to explicitly evaluate energy-related risks during the commercial loan underwriting. To support such efforts, the objective of this paper is to suggest a novel target-setting practice that borrowers and lenders collaboratively can use during the early stages of an energy-retrofit project. The practice uses a simulation called energy retrofit loan analysis model (ERLAM) to determine the target-building performance and the allowable cost for design and construction. Using a case study of an energy-retrofit project, this paper demonstrates use of ERLAM by evaluating the effect of two identified energy-related uncertainties (project-cost risk and operational-practice risk) on the financial performance of the investment. This target-setting practice can help project parties gain greater understanding and early confidence in the feasible size and terms of a loan before moving to design development. As a result, the practice can support commercial underwriting by helping to overcome financial barriers to energy-retrofit projects. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The Toyota Way model is known to be a comprehensive management framework with two main two objectives: continuous improvement and respect for people. In contrast to the enormous amount of attention focused on lean tools and process-oriented improvement, less is known about the softer aspects of such practices. The purpose of this paper is to explore the current practices of people management within large Chinese construction firms and their relevance to the Toyota Way. Addressing the gaps identified can help Chinese construction firms understand the missing link of human resource management practice in the lean context. This paper is qualitative in nature and is based on semi-structured interviews with 27 Chinese construction industry professionals. Several practices associated with the Toyota Way style people management have been identified in this study, including selectivity in recruitment, training and individual development, teamwork, motivation and organizational support. The research determines which of the practices from a range of generally recognized Toyota Way people management were in fact followed and which are currently not used. Additionally, the potential hindrances to several practices, which were seen to be implemented only with difficulty, are also identified. The results will be of value to readers with interests in lean production, human resource practices, the Toyota Way and the management and implementation of human resource management in the context of lean or within project-based firms, such as construction firms. The limitations of this study are that small and medium enterprises are excluded and that the sample contains unequal numbers of interviewees from private firms and state-owned enterprises, which would potentially affect the generalization of the implementation of Toyota Way style people management to the entire construction industry in China. ©2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Lean system thinking concerning the mechanics of construction production systems suggests that the Last Planner System (LPS) improves workflow by creating pull flow and by filtering work packages for maturity. However, empirical evidence shows that even where implemented only partially, LPS can still improve workflow. The authors hypothesize that the LPS engenders a social network among the subcontractors, which enhances coordination. Twelve residential construction projects were studied using action research over periods from 7 to 16 months to measure the impact of the LPS on social networks. Centrality degrees of trade crews rose significantly and the number of active essential communication channels roughly doubled when comparing projects with low and high planning best-practice index scores, showing that where the LPS is more thoroughly implemented, social networks are strengthened. The results contribute new understanding of the LPS and its mechanism. The LPS not only functions on the technical level to improve production control, it also has social impact, building relationships among construction teams that can contribute to improved coordination. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - General constructors prepare submittal documents using a push system, thus generating a submittal inventory. The submitted documents are subject to amendment and re-review due to change orders, resulting in waste through rework. The objective of this research is to develop a Lean Concurrent Submittal Review System (LCSRS) to reduce waste in the submittal review process. In the system, a stable construction process is established by integrating the various stakeholders. Submittal documents are pulled by construction status to decrease submittal inventory, thus reducing the impact of change orders on construction flow. To validate the applicability of the proposed system, computer simulation models are constructed using eM-Plant software, allowing for comparisons between regular and lean review systems. Experimental results show that the proposed LCSRS can reduce submittal inventory and change order impact, while promoting stable construction flow. This study is one of the first to apply lean manufacturing to the submittal review process in the construction industry. The proposed system could be used as a platform to promote collaboration between general contractors and supervisory units. © 2015, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Construction planning takes place at many levels. This paper pertains to the level called lookahead planning, during which planners make their plan more realistic as construction tasks approach execution. To improve the quality of lookahead planning, the construction industry has benefited from implementing the Last Planner® System (LPS) that emphasizes creating reliable workflow. Successful lookahead planning relies on task anticipation by breaking down tasks to the level of operations, designing those operations, and making tasks ready by identifying and removing their constraints so that tasks can become executable assignments. This paper presents a study, using computer simulation, of the relationship between improving Task Anticipated (TA) in lookahead planning and overall project duration. The results indicate that increasing TA can have a positive influence on reducing project duration. The authors recommend that industry practitioners use the TA metric to gauge their planning performance and then to improve on it. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Value delivery is basically the main purpose of construction, and in fact it is not the physical construction in itself that a client buys but the attributes or value the building provides. This value delivery is undertaken in a complex endeavour of collaboration. Throughout a building project value is in focus both implicit and explicit. Often challenges or direct problems arise during the process, which may be due to an incongruent perception of value. A survey was conducted among practitioners of the Danish building industry, aiming at investigating whether or not practitioners perceive value differently. The survey revealed that the practitioners had a diverse understanding of how to perceive value in a building project. This is problematic for the efficiency and effectiveness of building projects. Value is the underlying concept of emerging methods and concepts such as Lean Construction, Value Management and Partnering. When a homogeneous understanding of value does not exist, the full potential of applying value based concepts will not occur. © 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - Formwork material and payroll are among the greatest costs in building reinforced concrete structures. Therefore, formwork engineering is a key factor affecting project success. Traditional formwork construction entails non-value-adding activities resulting in waste. The objective of this study is to adapt lean manufacturing techniques to formwork engineering in a bid to reduce waste, specifically by developing a lean formwork construction model. In the model, andon is used to establish an on-site quality control culture, allowing form workers to obtain assistance immediately whenever a problem occurs. In addition, formwork operations are pulled through the kanban system to reduce mould inventory and achieve continuous construction flow. A case study is used to validate the applicability of the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model can effectively reduce waste in the formwork construction flow and increase the value of operations, thus providing a new approach to improving formwork engineering.

AB  - Simulations and classroom games are effective hands-on learning tools for construction management students and practitioners. This paper presents the background, methods and results of a new simulation management game called LEBSCO, which simulates aspects of the Last Planner System (LPS) and Lean Production principles. LPS is central to the implementation of Lean Construction, an increasingly popular management approach based on the Toyota Production System and Lean Production. LPS requires continuous and collaborative effort from all stakeholders for the planning and control of a construction project, making it especially appropriate for the experiential learning allowed by simulation. LEBSCO consists of the assembly of Lego™ pieces to form a schematic house, and it is played by teams meeting in rounds simulating weeks of work. Each team is composed of stakeholders, such as a planner, resource suppliers and trade foremen, mirroring the planning and control process of a typical construction project. Participants build the Lego houses first using a Traditional management approach and then using Lean-based approach. A graduate course in construction management at The University of Auckland, New Zealand, is used as a case study to test the effectiveness of LEBSCO as a teaching method. The implementation results of LESBCO demonstrated its capability to transfer and disseminate Lean-based knowledge into construction. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Why do Koskela and others argue that the underlying theory of project management (PM) is obsolete? Project management works for the manufacturing industry, and for the construction industry at both the physical production level and the subcontractor level. Stakeholders, including the owner (along with due diligence, and O&M teams), architect (and the design team), general contractor (and its subcontractor team) create, transmit, process, manage and use information. The boundary between information (creation and transmission) and physical production is where PM controls and predicts cost and schedule and where quality controls fail to work as intended. This paper argues that subcontractors give project numbers for the physical part of the project, while general contractors' project numbers are actually a project of projects (those of the subcontractors). The general contractor manages a meta-project (term and definition, as related to building construction, coined by Fernandez-Solis). The meta-project paradigm has significant consequences and is the key to a novel understanding of the general contractor role. Lean construction's percent (or promise) plan complete (PPC) gages the reliability of promises made, is a useful and viable indicator of the quality of the schedule, and serves as a surrogate measure of project flow – how smoothly or chaotically a project runs. The PPC is operationalized as an index that meta-project stakeholders can use to calibrate the reliability of work in progress and provide feedback on the predictability/variability of logistic plans. The methodology of this paper uses conceptual analysis, the metonymic mapping of key concepts from the thermodynamics domain to the construction domain and showcases the concepts through PPC case studies. Information entropy theories are discerned in the PPC reports. In conclusion, scientific information theories, principles and characteristics of flow, in contrast to managerial principles, provide a clearer background for visualizing a novel understanding of the state of the project flow at the meta-project level. It could be argued that this paper is about defining a reference discipline and construed as “construction science viewed through the lens of entropy” but this is not the focus of this paper but the topic of the next. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The majority of currently used construction productivity management systems rely on result-based management techniques, which have difficulties in managing in uncertain environments. Massive amounts of time and resources are wasted due to conflicts between works and constraints in space, etc. Hence, we need to recognize the limitations of existing result-based management systems and suggest a productivity management index that is expected to ensure that the issues of productivity reduction are properly controlled.
Work flow refers to the progression of work in a limited time and space. Schedule delay and expense waste can be controlled by managing the work flow. Measurement of work flow is evaluated using 3 indices: Continuity Index, Variation Index, and Productivity Index. Therefore, this research suggests an evaluation and measurement system for work flow that shows the productivity of construction work both directly and indirectly, and thereby aims at an improvement in project performance by using a target index. © 2015, Architectural Institute of Japan.

AB  - Question: What approach can be used to teach Lean Construction for university student(s)? What are the results of the current approach evaluation and what improvement can be made? Purpose: This paper describes the Lean Construction teaching approach at the School of Planning, Design and Construction (SPDC) at Michigan State University (MSU). Research Method: The course evaluation was conducted by: (1) analyzing students’ perception compiled from the Student Instructional Rating System (SIRS), which is independently administered and managed by Michigan State University; and (2) an anonymous survey managed by the first author of the paper. To compile students’ comments on what is going well and what needs to be changed, the authors used the Plus/Delta format. Findings: Most respondents found the course interesting, enjoyable, and intellectually challenging at the same time. Some highlights on the course evaluation results and the implications of the course in professional career are also presented. Limitations: This paper only describes approach used in one university. Comparison to other university approach and evaluation will provide more feedbacks. Implications: The paper provides detail descriptions of an approach to teach Lean Construction for university students. It also provide feedback to the approach and what improvement should be made. Value for authors: This paper will benefit the diffusion of LC by sharing ideas and encourage other instructors to contribute their insights from years of teaching the subject matter. © 2015, Lean Construction Institute.

AB  - The quality of the construction production process may be improved using several different methods such as Lean Construction, ISO 9001, ISO 14001 or ISO 18001. Construction companies need a preliminary study and systematic implementation of changes to become more competitive and efficient. This paper presents a multicriteria decision model for the selection and ranking of such alternatives for improvement approaches regarding the aspects of quality, sustainability and safety, based on the PROMETHÉE II method. The adoption of this model provides more confidence and visibility for decision makers. One of the differentiators of this model is the use of a fragmented set of improvement alternatives. These alternatives were combined with some restrictions to create a global set of alternatives. An application to three scenarios, considering realistic data, was developed. The results of the application show that the model should be incorporated into the strategic planning process of organizations.

AB  - Similar to automobile industries, the large earth moving equipment (LEME) industries have a dominant assembly line layout. Improving the assembly line efficiency would improve the productivity of the line. This paper focuses on using lean tools such as time and motion study, kaizen events and spaghetti map to reduce waste in a LEME assembly line. For this research, five zones (or work areas) of assembly were studied and using the lean tools the cycle time was reduced to achieve a 15% reduction in takt time. There were four phases to this research effort: data collection, construction of the process flow map, creation of the spaghetti map, and the implementation of kaizen events. The results from this research demonstrate that waste in an assembly can be identified and removed by studying the process and utilising simple yet powerful lean tools.

AB  - This paper presents a personal historic view on lean construction, referring to the application of lean thinking to the delivery of capital projects in the architecture-engineering-construction (AEC) industry. Lean construction has caused a paradigm shift: it offers a new way of thinking to those involved in designing and managing AEC projects. The systems thinking that lean promotes began to develop in the AEC industry 20-some years ago and was spurred by the recognition that the then-current thinking about the delivery of projects was incongruent in many ways. The writer first offers conceptual underpinnings to frame this new way of thinking, and then describes her journey of discovery of incongruences in construction project management theory and practice. Along the way, the writer offers several partial yet complementary definitions of lean construction while giving examples and illustrations of the underlying lean thinking. The writer's thesis is that lean thinking helps eliminate much self-inflicted, unwanted complexity from systems, so that people can accomplish more using simpler systems. Readers may not necessarily agree with this thesis, but are challenged to at least consider that lean thinking offers a new paradigm for the AEC industry, and that it is worth pursuing. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The construction sector is undergoing important technological and organizational changes, and construction companies will have to adapt to these changes in order to survive. For this to happen, we need to incorporate and apply production and organizational techniques from other more advanced sectors. For this, the application of lean production principles to the construction industry - known as lean construction - takes on special importance. This study deals with the various lean practices which should be adopted to achieve lean construction. Lean tools used to achieve lean principles are mentioned below. Also Value Stream Mapping(VSM) a lean tool has been used to take survey at two different construction sites located at Adyar and Chrompet. The observation from survey reveals the time spent on non productive activities and the means of reducing them as a goal towards attainment of lean construction. © Research India Publications.

AB  - A lean enterprise ties together and synchronizes all elements of its value-delivery system to provide for the needs of target customers. Organizations applying lean concepts in a systematic manner have been highly successful from operational, market, and financial perspectives. Once effectively in place, however, lean value-delivery systems can be more easily derailed than their leaders imagine, particularly in turbulent times. We identify three potential challenges for lean enterprises: (1) locked operating model: failure to change the value-delivery system in response to market and economic disruptions; (2) backward drift to pre-lean practices: regression toward wasteful inventory accumulations, backlogs, and complexity; (3) lean islands: isolation of lean practices within the walls of the company. Our observations at Quadrant Homes as it navigated the Great Recession, supplemented by our research at other companies, leads to recommendations for lean organizations to apply in countering these challenges. © 2015 INFORMS.

AB  - Construction projects continue to be plagued by cost and time overruns, primarily due to poor information-sharing between project participants. Building information modeling (BIM) has emerged as a digital platform through which project teams can share information better and improve project performance. However, many barriers to BIM adoption exist. The successful alignment of BIM technology with work processes as well as willingness to coordinate among project participants are considered most critical for successful BIM adoption. Lean construction practices address the issue of improving coordination within a project team and provide some recipes for how enhanced coordination can be brought about. While the use of BIM as a mediating intervention to enable effective lean practice implementation as an outcome has been documented, the use of lean practices as mediators for achieving enhanced levels of BIM use has not been adequately studied. This paper attempts to address this gap and understand if and how lean practices can be used to enable BIM adoption. Using an ethnographic action research methodology, two metro rail station projects are studied in India, a country where cost and time overruns in many sectors are much higher than the global average. On one project, building information models were built and an attempt was made to use these models for enhanced decision making. On the second project, the last planner system was implemented for 6 months, after which BIM was introduced on the project. The extent to which BIM was used for effective decision making leading to accurate planning and timely completion of activities was measured. On the first project, BIM was hardly used for decision making. On the second project, lean practices created a culture of coordination that incentivized the planning team to specify the kinds of building information models that were to be built, which would align with challenges faced on site. These models were subsequently debated upon collectively and were used for decision making with regards to planning and sequencing, suggesting enhanced BIM adoption. It is argued that lean practices can enable BIM adoption and the two reinforce each other. This paper contributes to knowledge on BIM adoption by showing how lean practices reduce coordination-related issues within the project organization, paving the way for BIM adoption. Building information modeling in conjunction with lean practices can therefore be used on construction projects to improve project performance. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods can help designers address the choosing problem in building detailed design. Many, however, appear to assume that all methods are equivalent. This paper argues that differences between MCDM methods matter. The first contribution of this paper is differentiating between the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and choosing by advantages (CBA) by comparing them through an example. The second contribution is explaining why CBA is superior to AHP for this context. In summary, CBA (1) provides a more context-based analysis than AHP, (2) does not incorporate conflicting judgments for weighing factors as AHP does, (3) does not assume linear trade-offs between factors as AHP does, (4) does not assume that factors have zero as a natural scale as AHP does, (5) focuses on differentiating between alternatives more than AHP, (6) maintains the result of the decision when nondifferentiating factors are removed, whereas AHP may not, and (7) defers subjective judgments until late in the decision-making process, whereas AHP requires expressing them earlier. This presents a significant research finding, considering the wide use of AHP. Further research is needed to assess what range of design decisions CBA supports. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The desire to increase the financial benefit is present in all activities, but mainly in industrial applications. The process of continuous improvement shown in this study was done on multinational HARTING Manufacturing Romania SCS which aims to bring new lines currently without new areas for transmutation. The solution was found to be urgent and provisional one, following in the near future to complete construction of the new buildings. This need led to in-depth study of methods for continuous improvement in an attempt to find the optimal solution. This was not the only challenge the most difficult step was its implementation because of discontent and criticism by production employees. Another problem to be solved is related to changing supply system since the release the stocks and their preservation in production until fulfillment orders brought company's losses.

AB  - Purpose: This paper focuses on the authors’ contribution to modelling algorithms for key business processes, economic indicators and original mathematical model for improvement assessment. Methodology/Approach: Researching and writing the article one uses interdisciplinary knowledge (technological production processes were considered in unity with economic principles of their construction and management), a combination of technical and technological approach, formal logic and mathematical economic modelling. For justifying the scope of model parameters, it is used field research (enterprises survey) and method of expert evaluation. Findings: The research has showed the integration of theory of constraints, and lean manufacturing is possible and expedient. The observations of the model’s integral values and their dynamic patterns allow for important insights about positive or negative trends in production system development taken as a whole. The model enables to reveal the trends for particular items and draw the top teams’ attention to problem areas. They will be subject to further decomposing and improvement. Research Limitation/implication: The model can be treated as cross-functional. But as every enterprise has its unique production environment, it can be exposed to further adjustment to individual enterprise specific conditions. Originality/Value of paper: The indicators and mathematical model for improvement assessment proposed by authors develop and complement the existing system of knowledge about production management and can be used as a practical tool for control of the continuous improvement process in company.

AB  - The building construction industry faces challenges, such as increasing project complexity and scope requirements, but shorter deadlines. Additionally, economic uncertainty and rising business competition with a subsequent decrease in profit margins for the industry demands the development of new approaches to construction management. However, the building construction sector relies on practices based on intuition and experience, overlooking the dynamics of its production system. Furthermore, researchers maintain that the construction industry has no history of the application of mathematical approaches to model and manage production. Much work has been carried out on how manufacturing practices apply to construction projects, mostly lean principles. Nevertheless, there has been little research to understand the fundamental mechanisms of production in construction. This study develops an in-depth literature review to examine the existing knowledge about production models and their characteristics in order to establish a foundation for dynamic production systems management in construction. As a result, a theoretical framework is proposed, which will be instrumental in the future development of mathematical production models aimed at predicting the performance and behaviour of dynamic project-based systems in construction. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - The meeting of milestones presents a constant challenge in construction projects. One root cause behind this challenge is the presence of variability in the project workflow. In fact, impacts of variability at both the trade contractor level and project level remain difficult to manage. This paper aims to analyze impacts of variability in the workflow caused by rework and fluctuating work quantities. Toward this end, production data of two residential construction companies were collected, and a mixed method of mathematical and simulation modeling was used to analyze performance and productivity at both the trade and project levels. Performance metrics such as completion times, work-in-process levels, and delays were then measured in different real-life production scenarios. The findings clearly show that the workflow variability significantly downgrades performance metrics by causing inflated completion times, longer queues of uncompleted jobs, and excessive delays, resulting in productivity loss. The paper provides those who manage construction projects with recommendations on stabilizing the workflow in the interconnected network of trade contractors to improve productivity and performance. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in engineering management by enhancing the insight into workflow variability and its impacts on tangible performance measures. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The Empire State Building held the distinction for being the tallest building in the world for over 40 years since it was officially opened on May 1, 1931. In 20 months the building was designed, engineered, and constructed. In order to complete the Empire State Building under the schedule, the designers and the contractors in collaboration with other stakeholders of the project had employed a delivery method that bear close resemblances with lean delivery system. Interestingly, the Empire State Building was constructed at a time when the concept of “lean delivery systems” did not yet exist. The current article presents a descriptive case study of the delivery method of the Empire State Building project based on archival records and historical accounts. In the case study the authors have attempted to compare the delivery method with that of the lean delivery system and recognized similarities between the two. The current case study illustrates the ingenuity of the stakeholders of the Empire State Building project and should encourage practitioners to devise better production system to accomplish project goal.

AB  - Question: Management cybernetics claims that any successful organization responds to its laws. As there are numerous successful enterprises that use lean thinking as a management philosophy, including increasing numbers of construction companies, does this claim hold and if so, do these laws offer the opportunity to sharpen understanding of Lean Construction practices? Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of management cybernetics— specifically Stafford Beer’s Viable Systems Model—as a theoretical basis for Lean Construction thinking. Research Method: Review, analyze, and compare literature on management cybernetics and Lean Construction. Develop an example to illustrate such use. Findings: Through a theoretical approach of describing lean thinking rules from the perspective of management cybernetics, we were able to show that following this argumentation, the Lean Construction idea of Built-in Quality (BiQ) fulfills all requirements of a viable system in management cybernetics. Limitations: Only a small selection of rules is analyzed in this paper. Implications: Management cybernetics can help sharpen understanding when implementing lean thinking in an industrial context. It may also help identify new concepts that can be incorporated into lean thinking. Conversely, understanding lean thinking principles from the perspective of management cybernetics may also help to identify problems where the implementation of lean thinking does not live up to the desired results. However, further exploration of these potential implications is required. Value for authors: Introduce management cybernetics to the Lean Construction community in order to support lean systems thinking and spur interest in using the Viable Systems Model when diagnosing lean practices. © 2015, Lean Construction Institute.

Purpose: To bring to the attention of the construction community the risk that shared risk and reward approaches to project delivery are themselves at risk, and to promote practices that assure its sustainability. Research Method: Case study of a ‘failed’ shared risk and reward project by academics and industry practitioners, some of whom were participants on the project. Findings: The countermeasures to failure of shared risk and reward projects are predominantly principles of Lean/IPD project delivery previously formulated but not universally followed. Limitations: The proposed countermeasures need to be tested against more shared risk and reward projects. Implications: Despite its evident value, shared risk and reward can die unless both clients and service providers follow principles of Lean/IPD project delivery. Value for authors: The authors are strong advocates for shared risk and reward and hope to awake the industry to the possibility that it may disappear. © 2015, Lean Construction Institute.

AB  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been identified as a key computer aided technology that facilitates construction productivity enhancements through the elimination of various construction inefficiencies. Identifying these inefficiencies, their source, and their potential remedies offers a foundation for process re-engineering. The objective of this research was to identify the constraints in the present workflow for precast shop drawing generation and to propose a BIM-based technologically-enhanced workflow that would address those constraints. In order to facilitate in shortening the shop drawings generation process, (1) key precast elements were developed as set of parametric BIM components; and (2) value stream maps spanning the construction disciplines were used to recognize the mechanisms that drive the prospective changes leading to potential productivity enhancement through the implementation of lean construction principles. The value-added, non-value added, and queue times for the present and the proposed future workflows were determined from the analysis of the value maps. Through the implementation of the proposed future workflow, for the generation of precast shop drawings, the research concluded that there would be a significant overall productivity improvement for processing time and total time. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Last planner system (LPS) is introduced in construction to make the sites lean. LPS has been facing implementation challenges which result in a misused or limited LPS. To compare application with theory, daily application of LPS was monitored at three construction cases. In all cases it was registered that only parts of LPS were applied. When application was compared with theory it was found that some elements were misused. The four main schedules were all applied, but the interactions between the plans did not function. Moreover, the rules of the making-ready process were not observed, and were offered little concern. The result was a low-efficient scheduling tool. To overcome the implementation challenges of LPS the knowledge level first needs to be increased. Furthermore, there is a need for support in the entire organisation. More energy or stubbornness should be put into the implementation to anchor the changes deep into the organisation. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study how operations strategy (OS) innovation occurs in a project-centred production and organisation. Design/methodology/approach - A longitudinal case study encompassing the processes at the headquarters of the company and in two projects using lean. Findings - The operation strategy development commences at a middle level in the organisation, is underpinned and embedded in production projects and only after several years becomes embedded in the corporate operation strategy. Projects use lean principles in a differentiated manner. Research limitations/implications - A qualitative case study provides insight into only a single occasion of change in OS. More case studies would probably reveal several paths of OS development. OS development need to be handled as emergent, political and with contributions from several managers and management levels, bridging the vertical divides between projects and headquarter. Practical implications - A conscious and systematic vertical integration and interaction is crucial in project-based companies doing operation strategy development, something critically difficult at building contractors. Originality/value - The present study contributes to the small body of studies of OS development processes, by providing insight in how project-based companies renew their operation strategy. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Lean production is a management philosophy that creates competitive advantages and provides important savings opportunities for companies and organizations. However, there is limited evidence showing to what extent lean production can improve productivity and organizational performance in the mining industry. Mining is a critical industry in Chile, so to understand the impact of lean production, this research provides details regarding the implementation of lean production methodologies in three underground mining development projects belonging to a Chilean mining company. In all of the case studies reviewed, the implementation of lean methodologies generated performance improvements in related projects and construction organizations, with statistically significant improvements in workflow, actual production capacity, operational reliability, productivity, time utilization, and organizational performance. The main findings of this study suggest that the incorporation of lean methodologies has significant potential to improve the performance of mining operations, which is critical given the current and future challenges in the mining sector. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the waste occurrence level in the construction industry. It includes: first, identifying the mean value of frequency of waste occurrence according to respondents' characteristics; second, identifying the main predictive factors for waste occurrence based on latent relationships between initial waste factors; and third, identifying the waste occurrence-level indicator (WOLI) for the construction industry based on the main waste measurement factors. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 19 waste factors were sorted from the literature review. A structured questionnaire was adopted to carry out the survey. The respondents are professionals who have much experience in construction and management of project. Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, Levene's test, ANOVA test, and factor analysis technique were used to analyze the collected data. Findings: Frequency of waste occurrence in construction projects is quite high. There was no statistically and practically significant difference in means for waste occurrence between selected population categories. Based on factor analysis technique, there were five principal components extracted with 56.7 percent of total variance. The WOLI in the construction industry was found as 61.55 per the scale of 100. Research limitations/implications: The non-probability sampling was applied to collect data because of several certain limitations and difficulties. The number of data sets is relatively small. This study has only examined the frequency of waste occurrence without quantitative information. Practical implications: This is another study of waste factors in the construction industry, which is different from traditional waste studies. Originality/value: The contribution of this study to the practical project management is that a proposed evaluation sheet for WOLI could be applied for any construction firm. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0969-9988.

AB  - The lean philosophy focuses on eliminating waste and maximizing productivity through the pull system, employee involvement, continuous improvement, etc. Much has been discussed about the waste elimination and productivity improvement that can be achieved by applying the lean concept. However, as the consideration of the environment is becoming an increasingly important part of the construction culture, there is a need to investigate the applicability of the lean concept to achieve environmental sustainability, which is often used interchangeably with the term “green”.
This research therefore aims to investigate the contribution of the lean concept to achieve low-carbon installation in precast concrete construction sites through a case study in Singapore. The life cycle assessment (LCA) results show that the lean concept can be adopted to reduce carbon emissions in terms of eliminating waste and inappropriate erection arrangements. In the installation cycle of a specific type of precast concrete column, an amount of 20.9kg carbon emissions (71.0%) is caused by wastes and inappropriate erection arrangements and can be reduced by applying lean principles through a detailed simulation. Many lean management practices in site layout, delivery, stock and erection management are identified in this paper. Based on the results, contractors can start to apply lean principles to improve the installation cycle and eventually achieve low-carbon installation. © 2014 College Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose – As with many other procurement management concepts, the early contractor involvement (ECI) strategy provides an opportunity to tap on contractors’ specialist knowledge in the design stage, in order to address and forestall problems before moving onto the construction stage. Such practices have been shown to be quite successful, and are also advocated in the lean construction practice. Following this benefit, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between the operations of ECI and the principles of lean construction for productivity enhancement. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the literature review of 11 principles of lean construction and ECI, various relationships were proposed seeking to integrate the two domains. A questionnaire survey was conducted with different stakeholders in Singapore’s construction industry to measure the strength of the relationships. Interviews were also conducted to gain an understanding of the constraints, reluctance, and possible methods for implementing ECI in Singapore with a convergence with lean construction principles. Findings – The results revealed that, when employing lean construction principles as a yardstick, ECI does contribute to elevating the productivity outcomes of some lean construction principles – in particular, for reducing variability, reducing cycle time, minimizing steps, and increasing output flexibility. Research limitations/implications – It is promising to marry ECI with lean construction, and that the former does appear indeed able to aid in the productivity improvements of a construction project by embracing the latter. However, it requires the building professionals to raise their awareness of both lean and ECI, so that the implementation of ECI can be carried out in a more effective manner. Originality/value – In the context of the Singapore construction industry’s push for improvements in productivity, this study posits that productivity benefits in particular can be realized through establishing the linkage between ECI and lean construction principles. The lessons from this study can likewise be adopted by other countries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Waste in the construction industry has been the subject of several research projects around the world in recent years. Researchers implement different methods to reduce the amount of waste in the construction industry. One of the effective methods for reducing waste is the application of lean approaches. Lean construction is a result of the introduction of a new form of production management. Although lean construction is still evolving, its generic principles, techniques and tools can already be applied. Waste reduction is one of the basic concepts of lean thinking. In general, project managers tend to conceptualise 'waste' as physical construction waste, but lean thinking believes that there are noticeable wastes hidden in construction processes (such as non-value-adding activities and waiting time). We aim at examining the ability of lean construction principles to reduce construction process waste through a case study (reinforcement process). Computer simulation is utilised to reveal the results of lean principles application prior to real implementation. Results show that different kinds of waste in a construction process can be reduced via adopting lean construction principles using computer simulation. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The earned value management system (EVMS) and the last planner system (LPS) have been widely used as effective performance measurement tools for construction managers and production units at construction projects. While the EVMS measures project-level costs and scheduling performances, the LPS measures the percent plan complete (PPC), which indicates the level of planning reliability. This paper investigates the relationship between planning reliability at the operational level and project performance at the management level (i.e., the success or failure of a project). Analyzing the empirical data of 23 residential projects of a large construction company, the authors find that, while the production plan in the weekly schedule is correlated rigidly with the daily plan in successful projects, such a rigid correlation is not observed in unsuccessful projects. To understand this finding, the authors further conducted interviews with project stakeholders. Taken together, this study suggests that an emphasis on LPS indices causes subcontractors to engage in myopic behaviors such as modifying operational-level indices. Consequently, management-level production plan rigidity is at risk. The findings in this paper offer valuable insights and help project stakeholders understand the attributes of operational-level and management-level indices and their relationships. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a combined framework for system design using Six Sigma and Lean concepts. Systems Engineering has evolved independently and there are numerous tools and techniques available to address issues that may arise in the design of systems. In the context of systems design, the application of Six Sigma and Lean concepts results in a flexible and adaptable framework. A combined framework is presented here that allows better visualization of the system-level components and their interactions at parametric level, and it also illuminates gaps that make way for continuous improvement. The Deming’s Plan-Do-Check-Act is the basis of this framework. Three case studies are presented to evaluate the application of this framework in the context of Systems Engineering design. The paper concludes with a summary of advantages of using a combined framework, its limitations and scope for future work. Design/methodology/approach – Six Sigma, Lean and Systems Engineering approaches combined into a framework for collaborative product development. Findings – The present framework is not rigid and does not attempt to force fit any tools or concepts. The framework is generic and allows flexibility through a plug and play type of implementation. This is important, as engineering change needs vary constantly to meet consumer demands. Therefore, it is important to engrain flexibility in the development of a foundational framework for design-encapsulating improvements and innovation. From a sustainability perspective, it is important to develop techniques that drive rationality in the decisions, especially during tradeoffs and conflicts. Research limitations/implications – Scalability of the approach for large systems where complex interactions exist. Besides, the application of negotiation techniques for more than three persons poses a challenge from a mathematical context. Future research should address these in the context of systems design using Six Sigma and Lean techniques. Practical implications – This paper provides a flexible framework for combining the three techniques based on Six Sigma, Lean and Systems Engineering. Social implications – This paper will influence the construction of agent-based systems, particularly the ones using the Habermas’s theory of social action as the basis for product development. Originality/value – This paper has not been published in any other journal or conference. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Abstract Problems in existing methods of production tracking in off-site construction result in schedule delays and increased costs. To eliminate these deficiencies, an autonomous production tracking that analyzes real-time production data is proposed. A specific implementation of the proposed production tracking mechanisms has been developed for a large off-site construction plant in Australia, and is in the process of installation. The paper shows that: (i) The production model in off-site construction is always nonlinear in the outcome due to the presence of variability (ii) in systems with a periodic production target, deviation from the schedule converges to zero at the end of production period and the same downward trend should be followed in designing plan buffers and (iii) long-term production performance in off-site construction can autonomously be monitored and controlled by observing critical variables of production. The paper provides those who manage off-site construction with recommendations on effective production tracking and management. The models and propositions in this research are of practical value and can be used to detect impending production shortfalls against periodic targets in the short-term, and adjust capacity parameters and production targets in long-term planning. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A Mass Customisation model is discussed as a competitive positioning strategy in the marketplace adding value to the customer's end-use. It includes the user as part of the construction process responding to the customer's demands and wishes. To the present day, almost all proposals for Mass Customisation have been focused on the design phase and single family houses. The reality is that the processes carried out in the work execution are so inefficient that the costs of the Mass Customisation models are assumed by the customer and they do not offer solutions that support the change management. Furthermore, this inefficiency often makes Mass Customisation unfeasible in terms of deadlines and site management. Therefore, the present proposal focuses on achieving the paradigm of Mass Customisation in the traditional residential construction complementary to the existing proposals in the design phase. All this through the proposal of a framework for the integral management in the work execution, which will address change management introduced by the users offering an efficient and productive model that reduces costs in the process. This model will focus on the synergy between different strategies, techniques and technologies currently used in the construction management (such as Lean Construction or Six Sigma), together with, other strategies and technologies that have proven to be valid solutions in other fields (such as Business Process Management, Service Oriented Architecture, etc.). © 2015 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Prefabrication is a construction operations approach that moves project work to a controlled offsite facility to be accomplished in a standardized and efficient manner. Prefabrication is increasingly becoming attractive to electrical contractors to improve their competitiveness due to reported safety, time, and cost benefits. This paper presents the findings of an industry-sponsored research study to identify current best practices of electrical construction prefabrication and future improvement opportunities that consider prefabrication dependency on supply chain collaboration and labor union relations. The study tasks are performed in three main phases. First, current state of electrical construction prefabrication is identified through a comprehensive data collection plan that included semistructured interview, site visits, case studies, and questionnaires. The second phase included suggesting a set of best practices of electrical contracting industrialization, related to prefabrication operational/design requirements, role of vendor/distributors, and role of part manufacturers. The third phase involved the identification of future improvement opportunities for electrical contractors' industrialization, which include promoting mutually-rewarding relations among workers' union locals, and increasing implementation of lean principles. The study should prove useful to electrical contractors who seek to start or improve their prefabrication operations, and to industry advocates who seek to improve its performance through better supply chain collaborations and improved union relations. The major contributions of this paper include developing a set of data-driven prefabrication best practices and improvement opportunities for electrical contractors. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Office processes are repetitive, common to multiple projects, involve multiple specialists, and are necessary to support the work of trades. Not much attention has been given to the management of office-related processes in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) literature despite their importance in supporting core activities in this industry. Anecdotal evidence provided by industry practitioners and research carried out by the authors suggest that these processes lack transparency (e.g., actual durations are unknown, indicators are not used to manage the process) and suffer from low reliability, that is, planned times do not reflect the reality and are often underestimated. Aiming to address this gap in the literature, this paper presents a two-phase study carried out to investigate the submittal process in a construction company using lean construction concepts and tools. The study revealed that durations used to manage the submittal process are unreliable and often do not match what is indicated in schedules and contractual requirements. Actual lead times to process a submittal are variable and root causes for their variability are not properly understood; consequently, unreliable durations continue to be used to prepare schedules. The authors suggest that by using the method and variables presented in this paper for the submittal process, companies can take the first step in mapping this and other administrative processes in order to visualize the chain of tasks necessary to process information in their offices. This method provided transparency to the process managed and allowed the management team to identify areas that needed improvement in the process. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Many attempts have been made to thoroughly understand the lean approach and its application in construction. Among these efforts, the Toyota way model is viewed as an appropriate approach that pinpoints various aspects of lean, covering long-term philosophy, process, people and partners, and problem solving. Adopting the Toyota way model, this paper investigates the impact of the implementation of Toyota way on the quality and productivity performance of large construction firms in China. Based on the fieldwork involving a questionnaire survey conducted in China, stepwise regression was used to determine which of the Toyota way-style practices lead to predictors of project quality and productivity. This paper provides insights for improving the implementation of the Toyota way in the construction industry. The results show that different practices may affect specific performance measures. Chinese construction firms should therefore prioritize resources and efforts to implement the critical principles identified to enhance performance. For example, if construction firms in China wish to focus on project quality achievement, the critical factors are as follows: be responsible for products, employees, and society (from the philosophy model); the project manager plans the work with input from other parties; reject defective materials, components, and equipment; the workplace follows 5S principles (from the process model); work with partners to improve project effectiveness; take part in partners' production process (from the people and partner model); and conduct kaizen activities (from the problem-solving model). © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Improper design in the construction industry leads to change orders, rework, decreased constructability, cost overruns, and delays, making it one of the biggest causes of waste. The writers aim to develop a lean design process to enhance design reliability by creating a learning environment using the design correctness ratio. Waste is first identified by analyzing the planning and design processes. A new design workflow is then proposed using lean concepts to smooth design work, reduce unnecessary design errors, and increase design reliability. The proposed process can provide team members with feedback on design status and thus allow for continuous improvement. The lean process is conceptualized using system dynamics to validate applicability. Analysis shows that the proposed lean design process can enhance design completeness and reliability, thus increasing design correctness. Waste due to improper design could be reduced accordingly. The proposed process is one of the first to apply the lean approach to construction-project design. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The subcontracting procurement process is one of the most important issues impacting the costs of engineering projects and construction projects, in particular. Traditional procedures of subcontracting procurement tend to limit the opportunities for price negotiation and cooperative relationships between contractors and neglect potential issues such as engineering interface, construction risk, and waste. Based on case studies of construction projects, we propose a "lean" subcontracting procurement process (LSPP) drawing from lean construction theory. The process consists of a novel Seven-Arrangement operation plan and four types of standard operating flows. Not only does the proposed LSPP help sub-contractors eliminate various types of waste in construction projects, it also establishes a common information platform and cooperative environment that help participating contractors understand the work emphasis of each operation and the whole operation in sequence. As a result, the relationships between participating contractors become cooperative, potential risks in construction projects can be discovered early, and profits are shared between contractors. Thus, this process allows contractors to obtain long-term benefits. © 2014 Copyright © 2014 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - The lean production philosophy originates from the Toyota Production System and has been applied in the construction industry for decades to eliminate wastes and improve efficiency. Many studies have been completed on the application of the lean philosophy to meet the challenges of sustainable development in precast concrete factories. Many non-value adding activities have been identified in both site layout and supply chain for precast concrete manufacturers. However, the production process should not be overlooked from a lifecycle perspective. This study adopts a weighted factor model comprising of 17 precasters in the Singapore precast concrete industry. The production process is investigated using the weighted factor model. The results indicate that there are many non-value adding activities in the production practices that contribute to an increase in the carbon emissions level. Large inventory level, wastage of raw materials and inexperienced employees seem to be the most important non-value adding activities. The analysis provides good practice guidance and can be used as a checklist for precasters to identify the non-value adding activities in the precast concrete production process to achieve low-carbon production. The results will also be useful for regulatory agencies to provide recommendations for precast concrete manufacturers to reduce carbon emissions. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

Traditional types of relationships have proven ineffective in developing successful projects, and can generate adverse relationships between the parties negatively influencing performance. Using primarily an exploratory and descriptive approach, the following research has developed a tool to improve the relationships between those involved in the course of a construction project. Based on an extensive literary review in which the principles of Partnering, Alliancing, Lean Project Delivery, and Relational Contracts were analyzed, and considering interviews with project management experts, three types of relationships were identified that can be used to establish contractual relationships: (1) traditional/transactional, which operates on risk transference; (2) partnering/transactional with agreements, which promotes a win-win relationship between parties, supported by good faith and agreements outside the original contract; and (3) alliancing/relational, which uses a formal agreement to align objectives and interests of the parties in mutual benefit for the project. These types of relational/contractual interactions are implemented in an informal matrix that supports the selection of the optimal type of interaction for a determined project. There is also a discussion of the potential consequences of the correct selection of a relationship type so as to improve the project performance and the relationships of the parties involved. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - As the success of lean production is widespread, both inside and outside the manufacturing industry, there have emerged a number of models of lean construction, which look into the possible implementation of the lean principles in the construction industry. While it is commonly accepted that lean production has its basis in the Toyota production system (TPS), the 'Toyota Way' has developed as something more than simply the TPS. This study examines the current implementation frameworks of lean construction and proposes an alternative framework for the construction industry based on the Toyota Way model. It is hoped that this 'back to the basics' approach can be used to bring greater clarity to lean construction by means of the Toyota Way model. The comprehensiveness of the Toyota Way model means that it can bring about multiple angles from which to look at the lean construction model for the construction industry. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper analyzes key issues facing subcontractors in the context of a severe economic crisis, aiming to detect the factors that are critical for the survival of the subcontractors. Although previous research efforts have analyzed factors related to subcontractor performance in regular financial conditions, there remains only sparse knowledge of how subcontractors are to survive when economic conditions become dire, as they have in recent times in the Spanish construction market. In this research, in-depth interviews with managers of relevant Spanish subcontracting companies were carried out, resulting in the identification of eight factors for subcontractor survival: project delivery method, demand, financial capital, relationship assets, managerial assets, human assets, legal framework, and geographic scope. The project delivery method used by the owner and also by the main contractor is mainly based on price. As a result, the subcontractors' bids get lower, making them unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, subcontractors do not get financial support from banks easily to cover their additional financial costs. These facts push subcontractors to get a guarantee of payment by the main contractor, and subcontracting companies may even ask for payments in advance. Subcontractors also seek long-term relationships with the contractor. These trusting relations are very often a prerequisite to qualify and bid for contracts. Subcontractors have to continuously improve, plan ahead, and adapt quickly to the new environment. Therefore, subcontractors must remain flexible and maintain a lean hierarchical organization. Doing so makes it is easier for subcontractors to compete in both their native markets as well as abroad. To this end, the most successful subcontractors have become international during the expansion phase of the economic cycle; many of them went abroad with the help of a contractor from their home country. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Adopting innovations in construction is challenging due to the fragmented and project-based nature of the industry. As construction innovation is a joint activity with a number of participants involved in the process, it is essential to consider the role of interorganizational factors in implementing successful innovations. The aim of this paper is to investigate the components of the innovation process by placing particular emphasis on the enablers of, as well as barriers to, innovation adoption. A case-study methodology was employed to gain insight on how innovation is achieved within a construction project setting. Modern methods of construction and lean construction were adopted in the examined case concerning an urban regeneration project. The findings of the case study suggest that resistance to change, inexperience, and unavailability of advanced products were the main barriers to innovation adoption. The project team benefited from several mechanisms to overcome these barriers, including integration of the project participants and effective leadership. The case study is expected to help participants of the construction industry reflect on their innovation processes and thereby enhance the rate of innovation adoption. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Lean construction theory proposes a servant leadership model for project organizations in which the individuals who perform the physical work are supported by design engineers and project managers, acknowledging that value is only added in the construction process when materials are converted into improvements. The LastPlanner system of construction task planning and coordination proposes that trade foremen are in the best position to determine task durations, coordinate sequencing, and promise completion commitments. Consistent with lean thinking to involve trades in management, this paper focuses on the importance of specialty trade contractors and their foreman who supervise most of the physical construction work, especially in the commercial construction sector, by investigating the relationship between construction engineering and management education and specialty trade contractors. This paper promotes an increase of employment within specialty trade contractors by bachelor-level, construction engineering and management graduates by bringing attention to the significant opportunities available for students with specialty trade contractors, both as field supervisors and project managers. A survey of 148 construction students at five universities and 60 industry professionals representing 34 specialty trade contractors shows that additional exposure to specialty trade contractors can result in greater employment opportunities within this vital component of the construction industry. This research also reveals that construction management and construction engineering students have an interest in employment with specialty construction firms and that the specialty construction sector desires greater inclusions of academic content related to their work as part of university construction curricula. Furthermore, a road map of improvements is proposed that construction engineering and management programs could follow in order to encourage more of their students to seek future employment within the specialty contractor sector. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Current sustainable construction research has been focused mainly on the design and operation stages of projects. But the execution or production stages have not received much attention. Also, current sustainable and construction management approaches often deal with environmental and production issues separately. In this paper, a lean production tool called value stream mapping (VSM) is used to simultaneously assess environmental and production waste over the execution stage of construction projects. VSM considers the elaboration of maps that assist project managers in diagnosing the current state of production to propose improvements in a future state. While traditional tools deal with symptoms, VSM tackles root problems. This paper reports a case study of the VSM application as a green-lean approach in the construction of a hospital in order to improve its environmental and production performance during the structural concrete work stage. The main contribution of this study is to provide a fully detailed experience of the VSM application in construction, confirming its ability to detect the sources of environmental and production waste, quantify them, and suggest reduction strategies. It also presents the development of a well-established implementation process of the VSM. The case study reinforces the effectiveness of the proposed green-lean approach for improving the sustainable performance of construction projects because it can help to optimize the use of resources and reduce costs, improve quality standards, and minimize the environmental impacts generated by the construction of projects. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Working on construction projects can be complicated and challenging. There are many different entities and individuals involved with a project, and no two projects are the same no matter how similar the design may be. Construction engineers today need to be able to competently communicate, address complexities, and team with the different parties that each project possesses. In addition, the construction industry continues to evolve and advance with the use of new technologies, materials, and practices. For new, inexperienced construction engineers to succeed in the construction industry, they need to become well-educated in the core knowledge of construction and engineering as well as understand how to use new technologies and practices effectively and efficiently, such as building information modeling, sustainability, and lean construction. Communicating and working with the entities that construct a project, called subcontractors and trade partners, needs to be as important as learning construction and engineering knowledge and skills. This paper enhances past research on the core elements of construction knowledge that new engineers need to acquire in higher-education programs. These core elements are related to emerging technologies and practices; also, the combination of elements, emerging technologies, and practices then are related to subcontractors and trade partners. The knowledge of construction engineering and emerging technologies and practices will assist inexperienced construction engineers to successfully and effectively communicate and team with subcontractors and trade partners during construction on a daily basis as well as when issues arise. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - With the increased interest in applying integrated forms of project delivery to complex and uncertain construction projects, the building industry has been experiencing an increased demand for integrated project delivery (IPD). With the trend, many empirical studies have examined the collaborative characteristics of IPD and reported that participants must make the necessary transition for its contractual, technological, and cultural requirements. However, little study has been done to investigate relevant education, training, or professional experience that can support the transition. In response, this study used an online survey that was designed to investigate the level and type of education, training, and professional experience of project members and their corresponding level of background knowledge for each IPD requirement. The key survey findings include (1) project members have the highest level of background knowledge on the cultural requirements of IPD, but the lowest level on the technological requirements; (2) the group with more design-build experience has more background knowledge; (3) the group that received an IPD kick-off training has more background knowledge; and (4) having a lean construction class can prepare students for the IPD environment. It is expected that the survey findings will advance the education, training, and levels of background knowledge of IPD participants, which will enhance their IPD experience accordingly. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing the Last Planner System (LPS) to improve construction planning practice and enhance site management in the Saudi construction industry. Design/methodology/approach - LPS was implemented in two large state-owned construction projects through an action research process. The data collection methods included interviews, observations and a survey questionnaire. Findings - The findings identify benefits including improved construction planning, enhanced site management and better communication and coordination between the parties involved. The paper describes the critical success factors for LPS implementation. The paper also describes barriers to the realisation the full potential of LPS, including the involvement of many subcontractors and people's commitment and attitude to time. Research limitations/implications - The work reported in this paper is limited to two case studies. Practical implications - The study has thus contributed to improving management practice and may aid the establishment of a basis for the development of further research in the area of lean construction. The research outcomes can inform practitioners of the opportunity to implement alternative management methods in construction, and give a good account of the opportunities and challenges. Beside the direct benefits to managerial practice, the study also contributed to practice by offering practical recommendation that can assist in the achievement of the full potential of lean and LPS in Saudi Arabia. Originality/value - This is the first comprehensive academic study in the Saudi construction sector concerning the application of lean construction principles and techniques. The study has thus contributed to practice and developed a basis for the development of further research in the area of lean construction. It may help construction organisations to establish a new strategy and policies to improve their managerial practice. The outcomes of the case studies can be used as a reference for organisations seeking to improve their managerial practice. Copyright © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - The construction industry consumes a significant amount of resources annually, generates significant waste and produces a host of emissions. This study develops a framework and integrates three different approaches - Lean, Green and Six Sigma - in a systematic approach with the goal of improving the quality and environmental impacts of the construction process. A case study of pile cap installation was conducted to illustrate the application of the framework and associated results. The study highlights two issues within the pile cap construction process responsible for waste: delay and potential errors in material estimation and ordering. It describes the environmental impact arising from waste, and analyzes the root causes behind waste generation to enable improved process performance. A survey of construction professionals regarding the causal factors of waste in everyday construction activities identified ‘design changes during construction’ as responsible for 60% of waste occurrences during construction and thus confirm results from the literature. In conclusion, the Lean- Green-Six Sigma framework offers a comprehensive, multi-stage approach for process improvement and minimization of life cycle environmental impacts. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Construction sites are dominated by chaos and complexity, enforcing challenging conditions for establishing reliable and robust schedules that are easy to observe. The consequence is a large amount of delayed activities that again results in an unreliable schedule. Last planner system (LPS) was introduced as a production planning and control system to increase the reliability of scheduling task. By focusing on the removal of constraints, the LPS has successfully decreased the number of delayed activities. To further decrease delays, this research investigates the causes for delays at three construction cases. In total, 5424 scheduled activities were followed, whereof 1450 were delayed. The delayed activities were, besides the unidentified ones, categorized into 11 different categories and a statistical test of means was performed. The research revealed six often-occurring causes to delay: connecting work, change in work plans, workforce, external conditions, material and construction design. Furthermore, the study revealed five seldom-occurring causes to delay: space, equipment, rework, unexpected conditions, and safety. The findings have been structured in accordance to the preconditions used in the LPS theory. Therefore, the results can directly be applied to the making-ready process and used as guidance of where to intervene in attempt to reduce future delay. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Fuelled by an increased level of competitiveness in the construction industry, construction companies must continuously improve their processes to ensure high-quality and reliable products at low cost. The purpose of this paper is to support in defining Lean Six Sigma (LSS) projects in this industry. On the basis of our sample of LSS projects, we structured and analysed generic project definitions elements. We identified seven generic project definition templates. The templates include critical-to-quality (CTQ) flowdown models and operational definitions of each CTQ. With these templates, practitioners with local knowledge of their business are able to effectively define improvement projects. This paper presents the concepts of an effective project definition in the form of actionable knowledge that facilitates project leaders throughout the construction industry, and may form an initial of typical generic improvement projects for this industry.

AB  - Mobile devices in the manufacturing setting offer mobility and information whenever and wherever it is needed; these advantages allow for a more efficient workflow and allow the user to make more informed decisions. Due to these advantages, companies are reducing muda (waste) by using mobile devices (implementing Lean Manufacturing) and therefore saving money. Some of the mobile applications discussed in this paper are the following: Augmented Reality for assembly training, pruefcubing, remotelymonitored shop floors, statistical process control (SPC), and change requests for construction, and the two types of muda (waste) reduced by these mobile applications are "unnecessary/excess motion and defects3.".

AB  - The Last Planner System™ (LPS) is well-documented in the literature, and has sometimes been used to represent lean construction or lean project management. LPS aims to achieve reliable workflow by encouraging foremen to have a sense of ownership of the project programme and to build-in their commitment into it. This study reports on the perceptions of Chinese building professionals of the application of LPS in Chinese construction projects. It reveals that several components of LPS have already taken place in large Chinese construction firms. Further, this study employs a SWOT analysis to examine the possible strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat factors that might have an impact on implementation of LPS in construction projects in China. © 2014 IPMA and Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the construction industry, successful project completion leads to customer satisfaction. Schedule delays, however, may be caused by unexpected downtime due to rework/repair. This case study describes how one specialty construction company used the Lean Six Sigma methodology to reduce welding defects in turnaround projects. As a result, they improved project performance and identified solutions that were implemented company-wide. From a broader perspective, this research demonstrates how Lean Six Sigma can be applied in service-based environments such as turnaround projects. It also provides evidence of the tangible benefits that can be achieved within specialty construction operations using process improvement strategies. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study was motivated by long term observations of the construction industry in the Northern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The observations showed that the construction waste is becoming a serious environmental, economical and safety issue that affects the suburbs of the KSA. The study utilizes Likert scaled responses through a two-part questionnaire distributed to 42 contractors located in the Northern region of KSA. The first part of the questionnaire aims at identifying causes of material waste in building construction projects from the contractors' viewpoint. The second part seeks to rank the considered materials according to their level of importance from the contractors' viewpoint. The collected data was analyzed through Minitab statistical software. It was found that the most significant factors causing construction waste are: (1) inaccuracy in quantity surveys leading to overordering or under-ordering (2) the selection of low quality products; (3) detail errors in design and construction; (4) the order of supplies in loose form; (5) and the inefficiency in resource management. The results of this study show that construction material handling and managerial decisions have a critical impact on the cause and effect of the level of construction waste. The study findings demonstrate that the most important benefits for considering construction waste are to know the exact required quantities for a construction project and to plan and prepare an accurate schedule for material arriving supply. The study recommends employing Lean Manufacturing principles to eliminate the construction waste and to enhance the decision making process in construction management in the northern part of KSA. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.

AB  - Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a company of the Brazilian automotive industry as the administering site. The research began by identifying the organization’s processes and choice of a family of products to model according to the VSM approach. The integrated view between the losses in the process (VSM) and the unwanted effects of the adding value process were analyzed by using the Current Reality Tree. After the analysis, different improvement procedures are proposed based on the lean principles. Finally, a work plan is presented based on the previous steps aiming to achieve the proposed future state.
Findings – The analysis of this case helps to understand and identify the causes of the current problems in the processes studied, providing an integrated view between the losses in the process and the prioritization of steps for the elimination of such losses. The approach in its initial administration was robust and the solution steps were promising. By integrating these approaches, it was possible to verify improvement opportunities by identifying the losses and the basic causes that sustain the unwanted effects in the processes at the same time.
Originality/value – The study proposes an approach that enables a systematic and systemic analysis of the processes at organizations through the combined use of process modeling through the VSM and TP-TOC. Simultaneously, the losses in the processes and the unwanted effects are identified. Thus, through the construction of an effect-cause-effect robust logic, both losses in particular and the unwanted effects in general can be prioritized in order to maximize the improvement efforts in the processes.
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a case of integration between the processes modeling by using the Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and the Thinking Process of the Theory of Constraints (TP-TOC) through the analysis of productive processes of an organization, indicating the complementary aspects between them and their benefits to the organization. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - A lot of non value-adding activities are existing in construction practices. Most of them were left unnoticed or unattended during construction. Previous studies have shown that significant amounts of project values were lost due to these problems. This paper was conducted based on the basis of waste concepts in construction under the philosophies of lean production. A survey was carried out through questionnaire, which was answered by experts and experienced people in high-rise building projects. The results showed that the relationship of waste recognition with its control ability was low with 0.461, 0.695 and 0.701 for contributory time waste, direct conversion waste and non-contributory time waste, respectively. The test on inter-relationship between recognition, control and frequency of waste signified that there was only one case that has negative relationship (r = -0.236) for contributory time waste. The trend of connecting the waste factors to their cause was carried out by a cause-and-effect matrix. The most dominant cause for all waste factors belongs to people cause with 52.6%, and the most unlikely cause belongs to information/communication cause with 0%. This paper then proposed some courses of action to reduce or eliminate level of waste based on expert survey. © 2014 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A generic bill-of-materials (GBOM) describes demand for materials and their proportional relations to a family of products. Supply chain constructed from the perspective of the GBOM is able to respond swiftly to market demand and lean production can be achieved by managing the total cost of supply chain effectively. Based on the GBOM, this paper examines the control of production disruption risk related to supply chain and investigates the uncertainty of production in supply chain enterprises for the purpose of achieving optimal profits in supply chain. As the production disruption risk is controlled at a certain level, the selection model of supply chain partners, which is specific and more feasible, can be constructed. A combination of random simulation and neural network is deployed to approximate uncertain function, and genetic algorithm and simulated annealing arithmetic are also used to approximately achieve the optimal scheme of supply chain construction in the context of uncertainty. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this research is to examine relevant parts of the case of an Italian steel construction company's green field plant design process to identify best practice guidelines for the adaptation and use of value stream mapping (VSM) in the design of lean engineer-to-order (ETO) production systems. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the most relevant literature in the field of VSM and discusses its limitations regarding the application in an ETO environment. Based on the analysis of an industrial case, the original VSM methodology is adapted with a special focus on ETO. Information was collected through multiple site visits and semi-structured interviews with the company's key staff of the project, as well as examination of relevant company documentations. Findings - A set of guidelines was developed on the basis of an industrial case research. In this context, major attention was given to two aspects: the introduction of synchronization points in front of merge-activities in the value stream, and the splitting of customer orders into suitable production orders and equal time increments of work. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this research are limited due to the focused nature of a case study-based research. However, the obtained results encourage assuming its transferability to similar problems. Originality/value - This paper provides an original industrial case study with valuable insights for the adaptation of the VSM methodology to batch-of-one ETO environment. © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - 'Lean thinking' holds out the promise of dramatic improvements in construction production processes, especially in waste minimization. While there exist empirical studies of 'leanness' with regard to non-relational-type projects, there is a need to analyse its applicability in relational contexts, such as an alliance. The application of 'lean' to a project alliance in a viaduct replacement in New Zealand is investigated here. The primary objective is to define a framework to streamline improvements in processes and to verify the applicability of the defined framework to a real construction alliance project. Participant observations, project documentation and action research meetings were used to collect data on the waste identification and elimination processes. The findings indicate that the construction work in a project alliance can be improved considerably by eliminating or reducing waste. Moreover, the savings are substantial, as the processes investigated were cyclic and repetitive. This framework is equally suited to waste detection and improvements at the site level. Project organizations should detect needs and opportunities for process change and transform processes accordingly. The current lack of any waste elimination technique, which could provide a significant competitive advantage for industry participants, has been established. Organizational conditions exist in project alliances that help to disseminate and sustain the lean concept. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present a computerized integrated project management system and report results of a survey on the effectiveness of the system. The system consists of a scheduling system, material management system, labor/equipment system, and safety/quality control system. The backbone system is a scheduling system that adopts a production planning system and a project scheduling system. The lowest level in the scheduling system is a daily work management system, which is linked to each functional management system (i.e. material management system, labor/equipment system, and safety/quality control system). The paper focuses on the material management and scheduling systems to implement a material "pull" system to reduce material inventories on site. Details of material management and scheduling systems are discussed, and a sample application is presented to demonstrate the features of the proposed computer application system. The paper presents practitioners and researchers with a practical tool to integrate material management and scheduling systems for site personnel.

AB  - Value stream mapping (VSM) is an important tool of the lean approach and is used to identify value-adding activities and those considered wasteful of materials and the flow of information and people. However, when not applied correctly, VSM can complicate the identification of waste, lead to misinterpretations and assessment mistakes, and undermine the implementation of future improvements. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the main difficulties and limitations encountered during the construction of current state maps, analysis of the associated causes, and pointing out of guidelines to facilitate the use of VSM to map processes. To do so, a search and evaluation of papers in journals, conferences, theses, and dissertations was conducted, and the articles were categorized according to the field of application (factory floor, supply chain, product development and services) and approach (theoretical or practical). In conclusion, this paper criticizes some ways that VSM has been used, observing that important constraints created by its application must be considered and that when used incorrectly, the tool can lead to mistakes that can cause problems instead of benefits. Considering the problems identified, the paper suggests future works for improving the use of VSM for mapping processes. © 2014 Springer-Verlag London.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to contribute to the understanding of efficiency in value chains in new construction of multidwelling buildings in Sweden by giving three perspectives on how time is used and not used. One perspective concerns lead times from the start of briefing to final delivery. A second perspective concerns the fact that work in most projects goes on 40 out of 168 h per week. A third perspective concerns to what extent resources, here human resources, are used. Inspired by value chain thinking, value stream analysis and lean thinking, the analyses show major losses in construction processes and large variations in lead times. It is recommended that time gets more attention in initiatives for improving construction. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This article explores opportunities and limitations of implementing and experimenting with Lean Product Development ideas and practices in the design and engineering of a complex hospital project. In this environment, new forms of contracts have given rise to new forms of organizing teams to deliver capital projects in which architects, engineers, and contractors are co-located to promote collaboration and deliver projects with a strong focus on clients' needs. The Cathedral Hill Hospital (CHH) project is a 1.2 million square feet urban replacement hospital in San Francisco, California. It is not just designed to be a state-of-the-art hospital but also to break new grounds in multiple areas of design, construction and operations. Since the beginning of project validation in 2007, the Integrated Project Delivery Team has been applying and testing Lean ideas, concepts, tools and processes to develop this very complex project. The article's nurturing proposition is that CHH has implemented most principles related to the Lean product development system at Toyota, and that these principles are the foundation for the evolving operational system that supports its processes on a daily basis. The article contributes to the literature by providing an account of how different processes worked in a co-located environment. Copyright © Associated Schools of Construction.

AB  - In recent years there has been an increasing interest in maturity models in managementrelated disciplines; which reflects a growing recognition that becoming more mature and having a model to guide the route to maturity can help organisations in managing major transformational change. Lean Construction (LC) is an increasingly important improvement approach that organisations seek to embed. This study explores how to apply the maturity models to LC. Hence the attitudes, opinions and experiences of key industry informants with high levels of knowledge of LC were investigated. To achieve this, a review of maturity models was conducted, and data for the analysis was collected through a sequential process involving three methods. First a group interview with seven key informants. Second a follow up discussion with the same individuals to investigate some of the issues raised in more depth. Third an online discussion held via LinkedIn in which members shared their views on some of the results. Overall, we found that there is a lack of common understanding as to what maturity means in LC, though there is general agreement that the concept of maturity is a suitable one to reflect the path of evolution for LC within organisations.

AB  - Work flow and productivity in construction project production systems can be improved through thoughtful planning with systematic avoidance of waste coupled with the use of appropriate production control systems. Collection and distribution of accurate, reliable and timeous information describing the states of the processes and products are essential. This study examined the effect of an information system based on building information modeling (BIM) on the decisions made by construction trade crews when determining their sequence of work. A prototype system, called "KanBIM", was used by subjects working in a virtual construction site experimental setup using a virtual reality CAVE linked to a discrete event simulation engine, to guide their performance of "virtual" work in a building with sixteen apartments. The use of the system improved the process flow and eliminated waste. It gave the subjects situational awareness, leading them to perform the right work, reducing rework and time wasted. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Usually, the tunneling operation is on a critical path in road or railroad construction projects. For minimizing project duration, this study identifies feasible work scenarios, builds simulation models for each scenario, and then analyzes the average duration per unit length of driving distance and efficiency of tunneling equipment. The tunnel work face is usually advanced as far as the ground condition allows the intention to finish the work earlier. As the rock type changes, however, the length per cycle advances, and the work cycle time varies accordingly. Therefore, workflow variability occurs. Workflow variability in tunnel construction operations brings with it waiting time for each work crew and results in delays in the work process. This study evaluates the effects of workflow variability and suggests an approach for shortening the duration of tunneling work by adjusting the driving length of each excavation in the case of two parallel tunnels, not a single tunnel. © 2014 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In recent decades, the use of Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures such as conventional RC structures, flat plate structures, ribbed slabs, waffle slabs, etc. has become common in residential apartment buildings and mixed-use buildings in the Far East, South East, Middle East, and around the world. Numerous experts work together for the design, construction, and supply of materials. Reinforcement bar configurations are usually designed and specified by structural engineers during the construction document phase without input from the project stakeholders such as rebar detailers, fabricators, and spacers. Rebar detailers use shop drawings to form reinforcement bars for fabrication and placement. The adoption of new technologies such as set-based design and lean construction can save time and cost and ensure quality and safety during the construction process. This article examines and considers the contribution factors of downstream project stakeholders through their experiences such as rebar detailers, fabricators, and spacers during structural design using the Building Information Modeling (BIM) system. In this article, the novel modeling technology of placing reinforcement bar in the reinforced concrete flat plate floor system has been developed using the parametric design technology of 3D structural BIM, which can be converted into working drawings and shop drawings. The model can also be used for the rebar fabrication with an automatic bar bending and cutting machine. This research examines the interoperability among the structural model, the structural analysis and design results of a concrete flat plate that satisfy minimum thickness requirements and sustained and long-term deflection criteria. The numerical experiment for the automated concrete flat plate modeling using a 66-story mixed-use building in a 3D virtual environment including reinforcement bar modeling using structural BIM has been completed as the part of this study. © 2013 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.

AB  - Purpose: Non-value adding activities (NVAAs) are considered to be problematic in the management of projects. Reported research findings suggest that these NVAAs consume resources without necessarily adding value to completed tasks. The main aim of the research is to provide insights and plausible explanations concerning how NVAAs can propagate poor performance in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reports on a quantitative survey conducted among public sector clients, consulting engineers, and civil engineering contractors in South Africa. Using a framework that was developed from the literature reviewed, the study proposed three conceptual qualitative models that were based on system dynamics. Findings: The study suggests that NVAAs that are prevalent in South African construction can impact project performance negatively in the form of cost and time overruns. It can also be argued that although there is commonality between NVAAs that are identified in South Africa and other countries, their frequency and effects on project performance differ. Research limitations/implications: The findings provide further insights about NVAAs that are related to the South African infrastructure sector only. Originality/value: The study, which is the first of such in South Africa, could lead to increased awareness among South African project stakeholders that are concerned about performance improvement from the lean construction perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - High injury and fatality rates prevalent in all types of construction in the USA may be addressed by combining safety initiatives with process improvement through Lean. This study evaluated the impact on worker safety when Kaizen (a Lean tool) was used at a modular homebuilder. Twelve students who had completed a safety course and four safety experts rated the probability and severity of hazards (as determined by a job safety analysis, or JSA) present in three workstations; base-framing, sheet rock hanging, and painting. These ratings were provided after viewing a series of photographs taken before and after a Kaizen event performed at each workstation. The rating tool showed high reliability for all safety experts' ratings but only for students' ratings from the sheet rock hanging station. Students' and experts' ratings showed a significant reduction in risk in the base-framing station after the Kaizen, and student's ratings showed significantly reduced risk in the sheet-rock hanging station. Kaizen has the potential to improve safety in modular homebuilding and possibly, other manufacturing and construction activities. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the use of the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology in a construction company.Design/methodology/approach - In our study we analyze 62 LSS improvement projects carried out within a Dutch company. In our analysis we focus on both speed, in terms of throughput time (THT), and impact, in terms of project completion, of each project.Findings - From the analysis we conclude that the current THT of a project is about a year and we identify important factors that cause large project’s THTs These factors are then translated into recommendations for an efficient execution of LSS improvement projects.Research limitations/implications - The analysis is based on a sample from one company of the Dutch construction industry. The scope should be broadened as more companies adopt quality and process improvement programs, such as LSS.Originality/value - The narrowed scope, only one company and focused mostly on the speed of projects, helped to do an in-depth analysis. Therefore, we are able to present concrete and useful recommendations that relate to practical issues in the execution of improvement projects. These recommendations offer a checklist for construction companies in the project selection process, in situations of starting or improving an LSS program. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The construction industry includes a large number of specialized areas and disciplines, most of which are based on cyclical processes during the construction phase. With the introduction of the lean construction concept, researchers have begun to apply lean principles to construction processes. The research described in this paper applies lean principles to a construction operation using computer simulation. Simulation makes it possible to evaluate the effects of implementing lean principles into construction processes prior to real world application. A case study of the bricklaying process was conducted to quantify and evaluate the results of applying lean principles. Data required for constructing the simulation model were gathered from the construction site through work and time study techniques. Preliminary results show improvement opportunities exist in the bricklaying process due to a high share of non value-adding work. The results of lean principles implementation also reveal that lean principles can enhance the performance of the bricklaying process through more than 40% productivity improvement. © 2014 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Non value-adding activities, also known as wastes, have not been paid much attention in the current construction management. Previous studies have shown that significant amounts of project values were lost due to these wastes. This study mainly aims to examine the effect of waste factors on project performance cost. A survey was carried out through a structured questionnaire. The respondents are been experienced people in construction and management of building projects. The results of factor analysis showed that there are five principal components extracted with 56.7% of variance explained for all waste factors in construction projects. The mean value of increased project cost due to these wastes is approximately 9.36% of total project cost. An artificial neural network model was developed to estimate the impact of waste factors on project performance cost. The results of analysis showed that the difference between predicted value and actual value is quite small. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is 1.35%, and the R-squared index is 91.1%. Based on elasticity test, five main waste factors were also discovered in this study. A comparison between some selected countries was then performed to gain a general view about waste problem in construction. © 2014, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Lean construction is a new type of management mode of construction project, which is especially suitable for those complex, changeable and speedy construction projects. Besides, building information model (BIM) is “computable digital information” created and utilized during the design and construction of buildings. This paper takes construction project as the object and combines BIM technology with the theory of lean construction. Both of them will play a collective role in cost control of construction project. A case study is made to illustrate that to the construction projects, the lean construction and BIM technology can control their cost effectively. © 2014, The Open Construction and Building Technology Journal, All rights Reserved.

AB  - The complexity of construction projects is the main reason, why the construction industry is searching better ways of managing construction projects. Recently, the industry tries to get benefit from the adoption of two management methodologies. On the one hand there is Lean construction, which works well for stable and predictable project environments. On the other hand, there is Agile project management [PM], which works well for dynamic and uncertain project environments. Construction projects, however, are exposed to predictable and paradoxically uncertain environments at the same time. Hence there is a need for a methodology which merges Lean and Agile to a holistic unit. The objective of this contribution is to introduce such a methodology. Such a methodology does not exist so far and is different from the "Leagile" approach, which uses Lean and Agile methods in the execution phase sequentially. Through undertaking a comprehensive literature review and through conducting 22 interviews with practitioners in the field of construction PM, Lean, Agile a new methodology is introduced, which is conceptualised as "AgiLean PM".

AB  - To a professional responsible for the safe and efficient operation of an oil and gas facility, today's immersive 3D computer games might seem like only a form of engaging relaxation. Computer processing power can be considered as a sort of digital budget, which has to be apportioned by an application to achieve optimum overall performance. In engineering design, 3D visual rendering is less important than more immediately productive features such as responsive positioning of complex objects and sophisticated clash detection. But as processing power has increased, to overlook the potential of realistic 3D representation is to miss an opportunity to increase design productivity and quality. Based on the development at Aveva, for design tasks, only limited visual cues are necessary to create a convincing representation of reality. By incorporating these into its latest design solution, Aveva Everything3D (E3), the company provides designers with intuitive visualization without slowing system performance. Combining more powerful design functionalities with the ability to accurately capture the as-built asset and associate types of information with every other type is fundamentally changing the way plants is created, operated, and maintained. It now provides the enabling technology that will trigger the development of lean construction methodologies. It enables existing legacy assets to be brought into the digital environment for more efficient management, and it supports highly efficient, safe and compliant plant operations. The future plant will be both a physical and a digital entity.

AB  - The productivity of the construction industry worldwide has been declining over the past 40 years. One approach for improving the situation is using lean construction. Lean construction results from the application of a new form of production management to construction. Essential features of lean construction include a clear set of objectives for the delivery process, aimed at maximizing performance for the customer at the project level, concurrent design, construction, and the application of project control throughout the life cycle of the project from design to delivery. An increasing number of construction academics and professionals have been storming the ramparts of conventional construction management in an effort to deliver better value to owners while making real profits. As a result, lean-based tools have emerged and have been successfully applied to simple and complex construction projects. In general, lean construction projects are easier to manage, safer, completed sooner, and cost less and are of better quality. Significant research remains to complete the translation to construction of lean thinking in Egypt. This research will discuss principles, methods, and implementation phases of lean construction showing the waste in construction and how it could be minimized. The Last Planner System technique, which is an important application of the lean construction concepts and methodologies and is more prevalent, proved that it could enhance the construction management practices in various aspects. Also, it is intended to develop methodology for process evaluation and define areas for improvement based on lean approach principles. © 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many in the construction industry view lean practices as a means for reducing cost and schedule while maintaining or improving quality. This paper argues that lean practices can also be used to promote energy savings throughout a building's life cycle. This paper presents a case study of an existing building retrofit in Phoenix, Arizona. The project owner, a general contractor, self-performed much of the building construction and worked to ensure the project team aligned around the project's net-zero energy goal. All building systems, excepting the walls and roof, were re-designed and re-constructed. After retrofit, the building has achieved net-zero energy consumption; that is, the building produces as much energy as it consumes on an annual basis. Deep building energy retrofits typically result in larger energy savings than operational changes alone can provide, as these retrofits take a whole-building approach to design (i.e., optimize the whole) and implement integrated project delivery methods (e.g., (AIA, 2007)). This paper discusses a net-zero energy retrofit and how lessons learned on this project could apply to other deep energy retrofits for commercial buildings (where "deep" refers to energy savings of 25% or more) that may significantly improve building value (Miller and Pogue, 2009). The inefficiency of existing building stock supports the need for retrofitting: energy consumption in the existing building stock in the United States accounts for approximately 41% of the total primary energy consumption (US DOE, 2012). In order to reduce this consumption, existing buildings must be retrofit, through replacement or upgrade of their existing building systems, to improve their energy performance. Beyond the energy motivation, a building's operating costs account for the largest portion of the life cycle cost. Thus, deep energy retrofit projects offer an opportunity to significantly reduce both national energy consumption and expenditures. While much research exists on the topic of energy retrofits, very little explores the role of the contractor. This paper explores the contractor's role (rather than the designer's or engineer's role) in delivering deep energy retrofit projects. The contractor plays a critical role in delivering a project that meets the owner's expectations and goals and satisfies the specifications (Ahn and Pearce, 2007). Namely, the contractor executes the plans and specifications, giving physical reality to the design team's vision. In the case of deep energy retrofits, this role is particularly important, as installation and operation must conform to the design intent to achieve the predicted energy performance. Moreover, the contractor must understand the existing condition to effectively retrofit the building. This paper explores critical building energy efficiency measures and processes for achieving deep energy savings in retrofit projects. Specifically, we present the role of the contractor in a case study project in Phoenix, Arizona where the contractor was engaged in the project early in the design stage. This paper discusses the process of developing and selecting energy efficiency measures (EEMs). It explains the reasons for choosing particular EEMs, including a discussion of selecting an appropriate baseline for energy savings calculations, and documents the impact of EEMs on total energy consumption and design intent. The paper concludes with a discussion of recommendations that, if applied in part or whole, will increase the effectiveness of future construction teams in delivering deep energy retrofit projects.

AB  - The construction projects involve various risk factors which have various impacts on time objective that may lead to time-overrun. This study suggests and applies a new technique for minimizing risk factors effect on time using lean construction principles. The lean construction is implemented in this study using the last planner system through execution of an industrial project in Egypt. Evaluating the effect of using the new tool is described in terms of two measurements: Percent Expected Time-overrun (PET) and Percent Plan Completed (PPC). The most important risk factors are identified and assessed, while PET is quantified at the project start and during the project execution using a model for time-overrun quantification. The results showed that total project time is reduced by 15.57% due to decreasing PET values, while PPC values improved. This is due to minimizing and mitigating the effect of most of the risk factors in this project due to implementing lean construction techniques. The results proved that the quantification model is suitable for evaluating the effect of using lean construction techniques. In addition, the results showed that average value of PET due to factors affected by lean techniques represents 67% from PET values due to all minimized risk factors. © 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Prebid planning is an essential function of construction project management that allows contractors to obtain projects with low cost while achieving other criteria. It also helps contractors during project execution and management. This research applied the manufacturing industry's lean theory to propose a lean prebid planning model (LPPM) for construction contractors. The LPPM can significantly eliminate the main types of waste in construction projects because it effectively combines three important concepts inthe manufactureing industry: transformation, workflow, and value generation. This modelincludes seven arrangement steps, which are described systematically to help contractors with real-world applications. A case study was implemented to demonstrate the accuracy and usefulness of the proposed model. The results showed a reduction of 9.1% in project cost and 37 days in project duration.

AB  - Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to identify reasons for doing work sampling studies in processes performed by temporary organisations. Specific questions consider if the technique can be used for measuring productivity and if it can be used to compare performances over time. Design/methodology/ approach-A work sampling study of plumbing work in eight construction projects is compared with a similar study performed 20 years earlier. Interviews are made in order to find out how the work conditions have developed over time. Findings-Work sampling studies are of little value for measuring productivity as well as for comparing performances over time. One reason is that the conditions vary to a high extent from one situation to another. Another reason is that working conditions undergo significant development over time. On the other hand, the authors experience that data from work sampling studies are of high relevance for discussions on improvement opportunities among workers as well as among corporate managers. Originality/value-The paper builds on detailed direct observations of plumbing work. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The lean production philosophy has been applied in the construction industry to reduce waste and increase efficiency. It is until recently that the lean philosophy has proven to be effective to meet the challenges of sustainable development. Many studies have shown that lean philosophy can be applied in precast concrete factories to lower inventory, reduce waste and increase efficiency. However, the precast concrete installation cycle should not be overlooked following a life cycle perspective. This study adopts a weighted factor model comprising 30 contractors in the Singapore construction industry and a case study. Construction site layout management practices are investigated using the weighted factor model. Strategies to improve the construction site layout are presented in a case study. The results indicated that there are many non-value adding activities in the site layout management practices that contribute to an increase in the carbon emissions level. Little consideration of green building materials, improper specifications of the precast concrete products, lack of an uninterrupted workflow, and inaccurate estimation of seem to be the most important ones. The results provide good practice guidance and can be used as a checklist for contractors to identify the NVA activities in the installation sites to achieve low-carbon installation. The results will also be useful for regulatory agencies to provide recommendations for contractors to improve the installation procedure and reduce carbon emissions.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The most challenging issue when enterprises implement continuous improvement is how to select appropriate methods. The objective of this study is to develop a diagnosis model for analyzing appropriate improvement methods. The model is developed using enterprise diagnosis methodologies that consist of three components, the production system, fundamental management and staff mentality. These three perspectives stem from Toyota's 3 M's (muda, mura, muri). The applicability of the proposed model is validated using a real precast fabricator. The application results show that the developed model can be used to analyze the strategies required for introducing lean ideas in precast fabrication. © Medwell Journals, 2013.

AB  - Lean production (LP) has been increasingly adopted in complex systems, such as healthcare and construction sites. However, little is known of the extent to which the lean philosophy matches the nature of those systems, which have different characteristics of complexity in comparison with manufacturing plants, in which LP was originated. This article analyses the extent to which LP is compatible with the nature of complex systems, as a basis for the identification of learning opportunities for LP from complex systems theory (CST). As a framework for this analysis, both the prescriptions from LP and CST for designing systems are compared in terms of their potential impact on a set of characteristics of complex systems. Examples of how LP may learn from CST are identified as well as examples of how CST may help to tackle common difficulties in LP implementation. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - The importance of managing the early design phases effectively and efficiently is relatively well appreciated, although how best to do this is not so clear. The successful use of lean management in the construction phase, using the principles largely developed by Toyota, has opened up the possibility of using lean design management, thus helping to establish a systematic approach to the creative design phase. This study explores the interpretation and application of lean design management in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). A survey questionnaire was used to obtain an understanding of current design management processes and practices in the UK. Findings from 125 responses indicate that inefficiencies are related to ineffective design management processes (e.g. management of briefing, design, etc.) as well as problems with procurement. The main conclusion drawn is that lean design management appears valid for implementation in the AEC sector, but needs to be customised according to the project context in order to achieve the desired value for all stakeholders. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Shipbuilding is a convoluted process. The production system of a shipyard can be illustrated by using the concept of a pull production system. Lean is based on the principle of a pull production system. The shipbuilding process is improved significantly but the lean production system is introduced at very small scales. In a shipyard, different types of wastages such as scraps, overproductions, idle times, etc. are produced, lean is a just-in-time production system that can focus on the elimination of these wastages to ensure lower costs and lower production times and higher quality products as well as better service and delivery. Simulation modeling is used to evaluate the performance of the production system and kanban is a pull-type scheduling method that can be used to simulate the pull production system of a shipyard for the optimization analysis. The goals of this article are to identify the important wastages in a shipyard that can increase production time and cost, to design the production system of a shipyard based on lean philosophy, to derive the basic principles of the lean manufacturing as well as to develop the control mechanism of this production system, the simulation analysis of the production system done by using the lean principle, and to identify the limitations for applying the lean production system in a shipyard production.

AB  - Lean construction is the term that corresponds to the reflection of the production system developed at the Toyota Corporation (automotive industry) on the construction industry. Turkish contractors constitute a large portion of the local economy and are important global actors in contracting business. Lean construction-based research and practice, as a production management-based approach for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the construction industry, are scarce among Turkish contractors. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire prepared to predict the lean conformance levels of Turkish contractors and discusses the results. The comparative strengths and weaknesses of Turkish contractors for a lean construction initiative are highlighted. The findings that are presented in this paper can be used as a starting point to disseminate the research and practice in lean construction among Turkish contractors in the future. A similar kind of research can be repeated to compare the lean conformance levels in different countries and to evaluate the lean construction programs at different companies after the introduction of lean construction. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Lean construction has been articulated as a concept that can solve health and safety (H&S) problems at construction sites. The question is whether it is that simple. Lean construction and H&S work can be perceived as two different societal change programmes. The focus in this article is on how organizations implement the change programmes and what new forms of practice they stabilize as a result of the implementation process. In particular, the stabilization of new routines for coupling production planning and H&S work are investigated. Applied theories lie within the areas of change processes in organizations, H&S and construction management. The method was based on three qualitative case studies. Three major Danish contractors were involved in the investigation, and for each contractor a construction project was studied on site over a six-month period. Contractors are project-based companies and it seemed that the change programmes and the stabilized new practices that relate production planning and H&S work at construction sites were dependent on the relationship between the functional departments at the company and the construction project, the organizational location of the key actors that drive the change programmes, the 'softness' of the concepts that are implemented and the perception of H&S. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Interior and finishing activities in building construction exhibit high degrees of variation as a result of uncertainty in supply chains, variations in work quantities, client changes, and lack of predictability of the production capacity of subcontracting trades. Decisions must constantly be made concerning effective utilization of available resources. Reentrant workflow patterns, where a trade crew returns multiple times to the same space, make production control particularly difficult. We present a method for pull flow control at the operational level through real-time prioritization of pending work packages and daily regulation of crew assignments and trades' production capacities. Application of various heuristics was evaluated using discrete-event simulation of a representative construction project. The experimental results emphasize the importance of dynamic control of allocation of production resources to those mature activities that ensure subsequent (downstream) flow. The most successful policy was to use the second reentrant activity as a bottleneck and to regulate the capacity of the trade with reentrant flows to ensure sufficient feeding of new work to successive crews. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - WorkFace Planning (WFP) is a construction industry best practice aimed at improving productivity on industrial construction projects. It is now a common requirement in the construction contracts of industrial projects in Alberta. Since its debut, the implementation of WFP in different project contexts has not been formally studied. Construction project contexts differ greatly and have an impact on the effectiveness of implementation of any industry standard procedure. The purpose of this paper is to present a framework for identifying the context variables that warrant changes to the industry standard WFP procedures and to illustrate how these variables require the adaptation of WFP within an organization and on a project. The framework is illustrated with a case study of an organization and a project, which found that modifications to the standard WFP procedures were made at both the organization and project levels during implementation, based on certain organization and project characteristics. These modifications to the standard WFP procedures, coupled with the organization and project characteristics identified, are of value to the future implementation of WFP in specific contexts. Furthermore, the methodology used in this study to investigate the adaptation of WFP is useful in studying the adaptation of other industry best practices for different construction contexts.

AB  - The construction sector plays an important role in most economies; therefore, any waste reduction in a building's life cycle will result in a significant benefit to the economy. It is at the building design phase that most costs and wastes are defined for the entire building life cycle. Moreover, many forms of waste are also accumulated during the design phase itself. This article presents a new approach for organizing and managing the building design phase in a more effective and efficient way. This approach, called project cell, promotes concurrent engineering and lean management principles to achieve better performance during the design of a building. The project cell approach was implemented in the design process of a generic kindergarten project for the Brazilian Ministry of Education. In this case study, the implementation of project cell resulted in better productivity in the building design process as well as more effective building designs when compared with the traditional departmentalized approaches. The authors believe that introducing project cell may be valuable contribution to the Construction Engineering Management (CEM) body of knowledge. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Purpose - The paper aims to present the concept, the layout design and the evaluation performed of a flexible field factory for construction industry. Both the concept and layout are focused on flexibility and mobility factors, providing a versatile system for manufacturing and assembly that can be transported to construction sites without need of special permissions. Design/methodology/approach - The design is based on the design for manufacture and assembly (DFMA) principles, lean manufacturing, and construction industry experts' knowledge. Findings - The developed factory layout is dimensioned to fit in a standard 20-feet-long container. Simulation processes have been run to verify the viability of the system. The time estimates calculated in the simulations are compared with traditional in and off-site construction method estimates, providing quantified cost and time benefits. Originality/value - This paper presents the concept of the robotized field factory designed for on-site prefabrication, the design of which began during the EU 6FP ManuBuild Project. This reconfigurable and flexible system is oriented to the production of small and medium size modular systems. The viability of the field factory has been evaluated thanks to the application of a modular system for building installations called Service Core. Its design has been based on DFMA and lean principles as well as the expertise from construction partners from the ManuBuild Project. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The design process has a significant impact on the performance and profitability of a housing project. Therefore, decisions made during the design process should take into consideration knowledge and experience from other processes in previously accomplished projects, specifically from the production phase. How to capture and use production experience in housing has not gained enough interest, possibly leading to sub-optimal improvements during the construction process. This motivates research on how onsite production experience from similar previous projects can be captured and used to improve constructability without risking customer values. Based on the concept of constructability, 'design for manufacturing and assembly' and the theory of waste, the method 'design for construction' (DFC) has been developed. The four-step model complements the conventional construction process, and consists of the following steps: (1) specify customer values and similar previous projects; (2) identify onsite waste and cost drivers in previous projects; (3) develop criteria to evaluate constructability; and (4) evaluate constructability of the design. The DFC method is exemplified and tested through a case study, in which it was shown that the method facilitated identification of all problems that were considered in the investigated project. The method also highlighted other project obstacles that potentially could have been solved to improve constructability. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose - Construction resources are often limited, and there is a need to ensure resources are carefully allocated to avoid resource wastage and/or project delay. While mathematical and heuristic models were developed to resolve the conflicts between activities, none of them has been proven to be totally satisfactory. The aim of this paper is to explore this. Design/methodology/ approach - In this paper, a novel heuristic method known as a pull-driven approach (PDA) is proposed; and this approach encourages a lean consideration of resource supply and partnering between activities. Two case studies are presented to illustrate how PDA can be applied. A comparison with another heuristic approach, namely the ranked positional weight method is conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Findings - Using the PDA approach, all the activities strive to find matching partners to pull resources to their sides. The resources are, therefore, no longer passively pushed to a single activity with high ranking but a combination of activities that can demonstrate their superiority in resource utilisation will actively win the necessary resources. Originality/value - This approach has an ability to deal with intermittent activities and locate the lean (no-waste) supply level of each resource. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Encouraged by the remarkable productivity improvements in the manufacturing sector, the construction industry has a long history of trying to garner the benefits of manufacturing technologies. Whereas industrialized construction methods, such as modular and manufactured buildings, have evolved over decades, core techniques used in prefabrication plants vary only slightly from those employed in traditional site-built construction. The objective of this research was to develop and implement a production system for the effective application of lean tools in building components prefabrication. To overcome the prevalent skepticism among middle management, the lean journey started with a pilot project involving one production line. Over a six-month period, lean tools such as 5S (sort, straighten, shine, standardize, and sustain), standardized work, takt time planning, variation management, and value stream mapping were implemented to a communication shelter production line. The implementation successfully won the support of the middle managers and established the foundation for expanding lean practices to other parts of the factory and applying relevant lean tools and techniques. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The productivity of the construction industry worldwide has been declining over the past forty years. One approach to improving the situation is by the introduction of lean construction. The IKEA model has been shown to be beneficial when used in the construction context. A framework is developed in which the lean construction concept is embodied within the IKEA model by integrating Virtual Prototyping (VP) technology and its implementation is described and evaluated through a real-life case implementing the lean production philosophy. The operational flows of the IKEA model and lean construction are then compared to analyze the feasibility of IKEA-based lean construction. It is concluded that the successful application of the IKEA model in this context will promote the implementation of lean construction and improve the efficiency of the industry.

AB  - It is contended that the root cause for disagreement between lean construction proponents and management scholars is related to the new direction of management research which was proposed in 1959 in two influential books, by R.A. Gordon and J.E. Howell and by F.C. Pierson. It was argued that management was to be approached through three root stems: behavioural science, economics and quantitative modelling. The mainstream academic work on management has followed the guidelines presented in these books. Unfortunately, this kind of management science has also attracted vocal and wide criticism regarding its practical relevance. The 1959 work rejected the production-centric scientific management tradition - a tradition on which lean construction has been based. Thus, the underlying disagreement is about the role of production in management: is production a starting point for management or outside management? This root disagreement is demonstrated through two research topics at the heart of the development of management science after 1959: organizational theory, as developed by J.R. Galbraith, and transaction cost economics, initiated by O. Williamson. Based on evidence from the analyses made, it is suggested that the failure to include production in theory has been one major cause for the problematic situation of management science in the last 50 years. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this research is to provide a tool for assessing the impact of applying lean principles to the design process at construction consultancy firms. Through several interviews, a comprehensive model was built to simulate the design process, using data from a leading consultancy firm in Egypt. The model contains the main processes and activities that form different phases of the design process and depicts the interconnectivity of processes and activities needed to create a complete design package upon client request. The research describes how the five main lean principles are integrated in the model. A case study is considered to demonstrate the effect of using the proposed model on the design process and to illustrate how the design process performs differently when lean principles are introduced. Case study output analysis reveals 40% improvement in the lean process performance measured in terms of activity utilization rates. © 2012 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.

AB  - Civil projects executors are constantly dealing with the challenge of increasing productivity through resources optimization and their interaction; this has been addressed from different points of view using computational tools and manual tools. This challenge demands also, the implementation of new information technologies and digital tools as an effective strategy to capture reliable data that could contribute to improve the productivity, quality and security indicators. This work presents a value generation in construction projects, through the use of new technologies to capture digital information that allows a construction process re-engineering using Lean Construction philosophy and digital simulation. At first, the design and development of an autonomous and programmable module is presented, powered with solar energy, used to capture digital images of construction processes. This system includes hardware and electronic components such as cameras, video cameras, electronic cards, computers, solar panels, web platform and communication systems; all controlled by a specially designed software which simplifies the control of the equipment and its components. This system simplifies the decision-making process regarding the construction methods and the resources involved, in order to minimize the costs and to increase the performance. The results obtained in the implementation of the module in a construction project in Bogota, Colombia, are presented in the second part of this paper. The analysis of the results, the constructive process characterization using Time-Lapse videos and a digital simulation model of the construction process are presented. These results allow reducing cycle times and using better the resources, which is translated into resources savings for the project.

AB  - Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to investigate the history of dissemination and use of lean concepts in construction and potential challenges for continued use, as application of lean concepts transitions from a small group of first adopters to an industry-wide community. Design/methodology/ approach - Using insights obtained from a meeting with industry practitioners, literature review, and published cases in which different approaches were used to disseminate lean production/construction, evidence is presented that supports these challenges. Findings - The authors identify three challenges facing lean construction (LC) practitioners, researchers, and educators. One challenge is lean has many meanings (whether denoted or connoted) when applied to construction. Another challenge is to have academics constantly working with industry practitioners to keep working on the adaptation of concepts/systems and not only tools. The third challenge is that without a sustained effort to engage people in meaningful learning experiences, LC may be viewed as a fad in the construction industry. Research limitations/implications - The discussion presents the authors' interpretation of facts and existing literature reviewed to support the arguments made. Moreover, while the literature reviewed addresses sources from different parts of the world, the preponderance of the authors' research activities and experience are limited to two countries, Brazil and the USA. Practical implications - In the face of overwhelming interest in lean by the construction industry, research on effective methods for disseminating lean concepts is overdue. Social implications - By partnering with industry practitioners who are already implementing LC or want to start the journey, academics have access to projects (labs in the real world) and can bring back to the classroom examples to educate future generations of professionals who can push for changes in the industry. This partnership also helps the validation of experiments regarding LC implementation, as data can be collected and analyzed in a scientific way, and can be documented for dissemination within the industry. Originality/value - The paper discusses challenges related to the evolution of LC in the industry, with the aim of forming a basis for an informed discussion on how to promote sustained and informed learning in construction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose - The construction industry has been criticized for not keeping up with other production industries in terms of cost efficiency, innovation, and production methods. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge about what hampers efficiency in supplying engineer-to-order (ETO) joinery-products to the construction process. The objective is to identify the main contributors to inefficiency and to define areas for innovation in improving this industry. Design/methodology/approach - Case studies of the supply chain of a Swedish ETO joinery-products supplier are carried out, and observations, semi-structured interviews, and documents from these cases are analysed from an efficiency improvement perspective. Findings - From a lean thinking and information modelling perspective, longer-term procurement relations and efficient communication of information are the main areas of innovation for enhancing the efficiency of supplying ETO joinery-products. It seems to be possible to make improvements in planning and coordination, assembly information, and spatial measuring through information modelling and spatial scanning technology. This is likely to result in an increased level of prefabrication, decreased assembly time, and increased predictability of on-site work. Originality/value - The role of supplying ETO joinery-products is a novel research area in construction. There is a need to develop each segment of the manufacturing industry supplying construction and this paper contributes to the collective knowledge in this area. The focus is on the possibilities for innovation in the ETO joinery-products industry and on its improved integration in the construction industry value chain in general. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The importance of social issues is well established in the literature on resistance to change. However, much can be gained by including physical objects in the analysis. Using actor-network theory, this paper aims to explore the resistance of non-human actors in organizational change and contribute to an expanded understanding of resistance to change. Design/methodology/approach: The article is based on a longitudinal case study of the introduction of lean in a large Swedish manufacturing company. The empirical basis consists of interviews, observations and document studies. Actor-network theory is used as a theoretical lens to identify non-human resistance to change. Findings: The paper proposes that non-human actors can inhibit change through a lack of alignment with the overall change initiative. This may cause large variation in the interpretation of the proposed change and a lengthy process of construction and negotiation. The paper provides examples of four different types of non-human resistance that result from this lack of alignment. Practical implications: It is proposed that change initiatives need to be aligned with existing practice and anchored in objects that are integrated in organizational routines. The four types of non-human resistance presented in the paper may be used as a checklist to reduce the risk of failure. Originality/value: The predominant focus on social issues tends to disregard the impact of the physical environment in change processes. Actor-network theory and the inclusion of the physical environment will help to expand and improve the understanding of resistance to change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - A current trend in residential construction is the use of prefabricated wall panels. Panels are manufactured at a factory, then arranged into stacks for transporting to the construction site, where they are assembled. Current approaches to planning panelized construction are focused on stacking and transport efficiency, with little consideration given to assembly. This results in excessive panel material handling during construction, increased construction lead time, and increased risk of worker overload and/or injury. This paper proposes a lean approach to panel stacking, panel sequencing, and stack locating, where panels within each stack form a continuous structure and are erected via continuous flow. The objectives are to minimize the quantity of stacks, panel material handling distance, and the work required to position and brace panels-panel interference is ignored. Few researchers have addressed this problem: a single algorithm has been reported, and this only works for certain building shapes and may provide infeasible solutions. The proposed approach and algorithm result in improved performance, have no shape restrictions, and always provide feasible solutions. Additionally, computational experiments show that the algorithm outperforms methods being employed in the construction industry today. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Lean construction can be conceptualized as a process-oriented approach derived from the Toyota Production System (TPS). Elements of the approach include pull-driven scheduling, minimizing stock held on site, visual management, levelling workloads and teamwork. While there has been empirical study of Lean in relation to new-builds there is a need to analyse its applicability to other contexts, such as refurbishments. The effect of using Lean on the refurbishment of a municipal building in Germany is investigated in this study. Participant observation, archival project documentation and semi-structured interviews are used to collect data on the use of Lean. The findings indicate the difficulty of applying Lean to refurbishment projects, particularly operating pull-drive scheduling, and the experience of the project brings into question the practicalities of applying the fundamental Lean principle of having a smooth level flow of work to refurbishment projects. Minimizing stock held on site with JIT delivery of materials also proved problematic, which was exacerbated by the commercial arrangements between subcontractors and suppliers providing no incentive to Lean. The use of the visual management aspects of Lean, such as performance charts, coupled with weekly meetings, were easier to adapt to the project and generally had a beneficial impact. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Engineering construction has specific characteristics that separate it from other types of construction such as technical complexity, onerous safety, health and environmental regulations, duality of new build combined with maintenance and repair, largely owner/user commissioning clients, value propositions revolving around a production Process, etc. The recent Gibson report (Gibson, 2009) highlighted several significant problems associated with engineering construction in the UK arising, in many cases, from skill shortages and poor client-contractor relationships. Informal observation and a literature review enable 12 factors to be proposed that differentiate engineering construction from other forms of construction. A new paradigm for the construction sector is Lean construction. This is an adaptation of Lean production and is based on a philosophy that focuses on delivering improved value through the assembly of problem-solving networks of knowledgeable and skilled people. Accepting that Lean construction exists in theory as a method for improving a raft of construction production issues, the question is asked here as to whether it is also relevant to the set of additional factors identified as applying specifically to production in an engineering construction context. The discussion concludes that Lean construction principles can be applied in engineering construction and that an improvement in value could be achieved. Note: throughout this paper the word 'process' is used in two contexts-the design and construction process and the end Process that is the function of the client business, e.g. water treatment Process, food manufacturing Process. The context is distinguished by the capitalization of the first letter. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: The traditional value chain has changed under the influence of globalisation, lean thinking and the value leverage towards suppliers in the supply chain. The leverage of value by the focal original equipment manufacturer (OEM)-company to the supply chain has caused the focal OEM-company to transform into a large-scale system integrator (LSSI). The LSSI was defined according to the Petrick's definition. Indicators that measure the value-leverage by these LSSI companies have not been found in literature. The purpose of this paper is to describe indicators that measure value-leverage and illustrates that LSSI companies in the aerospace industry have a value-leverage capability, using these indicators. Design/methodology/approach: The authors' main research question is: "How to measure value-leverage by LSSIs in the aerospace industry?". As value-leverage indicators have not been studied before, a literature study was carried out to develop a set of indicators which were tested in a quantitative analysis, using secondary data from 41 aerospace companies. Second, the value-leverage indicators were applied to the aircraft LSSIs. The industry samples consisted of the global companies in the aircraft OEM industry and the relevant financial and company data were collected from the companies' public financial data, spanning a time frame of 14 years (1996 to 2009). A case study was performed on large-scale aircraft system integrators, as a sample of the aerospace OEM industry, to demonstrate the effects of value-leverage by aircraft LSSI companies. Findings: With the new indicators, this research shows value leverage of aerospace OEMs and aircraft LSSIs as a sub group of the sample. The related indicators showed a change in leverage over time, indicating the leverage capability of aerospace OEMs. More in-depth analysis on aircraft LSSI companies showed that aircraft LSSI with high correlation on the value-leverage variables are more in value balance compared with aircraft LSSI companies scoring lower on the variables. Research limitations/implications: This research has been limited to the aerospace OEMs. Data from secondary (public) sources were used, such as financial reports over a period of 14 years. Further research is necessary to develop indicators for other sectors of industries, such as automotive, medical instruments and construction, as well as to further improve the understanding of the outcomes of this study. Practical implications: The new indicators measure value-leverage of aerospace OEMs in general and aircraft LSSI companies. These companies could be compared on their capability of value-leverage. Management of these firms can use the indicators to further improve their capability of value-leverage on the supply chain regarding co-development and co-production of aircraft and related systems. Social implications: It is useful for the executive management of aircraft LSSIs to balance the value leverage of their companies regarding R&D, customer demand and supply chain based production. Originality/value: The paper identifies indicators that measure the capability of the aerospace OEMs to leverage value on supply chains. The found indicators form a preliminary model, which contributes to the usage of theories on lean manufacturing, supply chain management, value networks and open innovation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Our experience in engineering education and practice indicates that methodologies for architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) design management are characterized only to a limited extent. In domains other than AEC such methodologies are well-established and contribute to improving design performance. A step towards advancing AEC design management is to characterize design practices and explore the methodologies on which they may be based. In this vein, the authors describe a design practice observed while participating in the development of a design-build-operate-and-maintain (DBOM) proposal for an infrastructure megaproject. The development team's design process followed a point-based methodology, i.e., early selection from a small set of design alternatives. The team was structured as a three-party joint venture, but, as observed, integration of efforts and collaboration among its design engineers and contractors were difficult and infrequent. The point-based design methodology used showed limitations. The authors counterpose methodologies including select-and-reuse or set-based design. Especially the latter is worth adopting in our AEC industry because it has resulted in superior design performance in other domains. By characterizing and documenting a design management methodology used in practice and counterposing alternatives, the authors aim to spur discussion on the teaching and practical application of AEC design management methodologies. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Sustainability and lean concepts can both be applied to the construction industry to help minimize waste. Although both concepts work to alleviate similar problems, organizations struggle to integrate the concepts. This paper examined projects of different sizes and in different environments within the Midwestern United States to determine what aspects hinder the integration of sustainability and lean concepts within the region. Professionals associated with the industry were interviewed to identify sources of waste for lean and sustainable projects. From the case studies, various aspects of waste that exist in construction projects were recognized, and a comparison of the interaction of lean and sustainable concepts was documented. A process for planning throughout the entire construction process was determined so that waste can be reduced and the integration of lean and sustainable concepts is more achievable. © 2012 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The construction industry plays an important role in establishing the infrastructure required for socio-economic development and directly contributes to economic growth. On the other side, it also generates severe impacts on the environment. The construction industry is one of the biggest environmental polluters and it also consumes large quantities of raw materials. Value Engineering originates from the manufacturing industry in order to deliver higher value and quality to a product by means of an increase in efficiency. 'Lean Construction' (LC) concepts emerged as a consequence of the application of VE philosophy, specifically for construction industry. LC extends from the objectives of a lean production system - to maximize value and to minimize waste - in relation to specific techniques and then applies them conceptually in a new project delivery process. The aims of this paper are to present practical examples of the application of Value Engineering and Lean Construction concepts within a green building construction project and to qualitatively assess its benefits in terms of environmental impact and waste minimization. A detailed case study was conducted for project execution of a new multi-storey government institutional building in the Jakarta central business district. This project adopts a Green Building and a Green Site concept in order to reduce potential environmental impact during the construction phase itself and during the occupancy phase of the building. The case study primarily concerns issues such as water consumption, power usage, etc. This project is a perfect example for the application of Value Engineering and Lean Construction philosophies in order to deliver better quality, faster completion, environmentally friendly practice, and less waste generation. The adoption of environmental awareness in the context of building design, the application of alternative and/or recycled/environmentally friendly materials, along with a number of "green" technologies and building systems featured in this building concept will deliver greater value without jeopardizing the ecology. Meanwhile, the adoption of prefabrication construction methods, intelligent excavation works, 'Reduce-Reuse-Recycle' principles, and simple 'environmentally-aware' on-site practices can minimize the waste produced and the local environmental impact emitted during project execution. © IJTech 2012.

AB  - Construction activities and the built environment have an enormous effect on the environment, human health, and the overall economy. Sustainable homebuilding in all three dimensions of economic, environmental, and social effects is attainable through practical innovations and technologies. However, the greatest barrier to the widespread application of sustainable homebuilding is the higher initial costs largely attributable to the learning curve of workers building with these practical innovations and technologies, and the added cost resulting from ill-defined construction processes. To address these challenges and reach the ideal of sustainable construction, this paper proposes the use of lean construction as a viable and effective strategy, in particular the lean tool kaizen. This paper uses several case studies to showcase the effect of lean on the triple bottom line of sustainability in modular homebuilding. Each case study highlights one dimension of sustainability. Lean construction resulted in a significant environmental effect by reducing material waste by 64%, a significant social effect by reducing or eliminating key safety hazards of excessive force, poor posture, and struck-by, and a significant economic effect by reducing production hours by 31%. Findings from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the effect of lean on homebuilding sustainability and will promote lean and safe building techniques in modular homebuilding. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Although prefabrication is becoming popular as an approach to conquer the chronic problems in construction, it has inherent issues related to inefficiencies in its production process. To address these production process related inefficiencies, lean production principles (LPP) can be applied. Hence, this paper aims to investigate the application of LPP to the precast concrete bridge beam production process (PCBBPP). The research collected data within three selected case studies by observing PCBBPP and interviewing executive-level professionals, to map the process, to identify conversion activities and their efficiency enhancing methods, and to record flow activities and their associate waste, waste causes, and elimination/minimization methods. The research analysed data by using code-based content analysis, and the findings are presented by using tables, matrices, and maps. The results revealed 103 activities associated with PCBBPP, of which 59 are conversion activities. Among 44 flow activities, 17 can be eliminated. The results also indicated several methods and techniques to eliminate/minimize flow activities and enhance the efficiency of PCBBPP conversion activities to enable implementation of LPP in prefabrication yards. By applying LPP to PCBBPP, several long-term benefits were revealed that contribute to sustainable construction. These results are useful for prefabrication companies and those who deal with sustainability issues. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Recently demands for larger and more complicated construction projects are increasing, and tremendous efforts are made to improve the productivity of construction industry. The traditional method of conducting structural design is of sequential engineering concept like point-based design in which designers determine the initial design plan based on designer's experience and judgment and then proceed with detailed design. However, Set-based Design (SBD) of concurrent engineering concept is lean design that eliminates wasting elements and increases the potential for the improvement of productivity in overall project standpoint by sharing information and collaborating with relevant fields. In addition, S-BIM (Structural Building Information Modeling) provides an environment flexible to exchange information and collaborate with relevant field for the execution of SBD. In this study, on the basis of S-BIM, a SBD procedure is established and a case study is performed with the procedure. The case study shows the proposed SBD procedure has a high efficiency in the selection of the global optimal alternatives of structural floor systems considering the constructability, structural capacity and economical feasibility simultaneously. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

AB  - Target costing is an effective management technique that has been used in manufacturing for decades to achieve cost predictability during new product development. Adoption of this technique promises benefits for the construction industry as it struggles to raise the number of successful outcomes and certainty of project delivery in terms of cost, quality and time. Target value design is a management approach that takes the best features of target costing and adapts them to the peculiarities of construction. The concept of target value design is introduced based on the results of action research carried out on 12 construction projects in the USA. It has been shown that systemic application of target value design leads to significant improvement of project performance-the final cost of projects was on average 15% less than market cost. The construction industry already has approaches that have similarities with elements of the target value design process or use the same terminology, e.g. partnering and target cost contracts, cost planning, etc. Following an exploration of the similarities and differences target value design is positioned as a form of target costing for construction that offers a more reliable route to successful project outcomes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the current economic climate the UK construction industry needs to start with a blank canvas and rethink its strategy in order to become more innovative, efficient and effective. This paper identifies the current state of the industry and establishes a method for eliminating waste and improving efficiency. Adoption of a 'Lean' culture will enable the industry to become more innovative and deliver better value for money. Lean is a proven technique that eliminates non-value activities and enhances those that do add value, thus providing more efficient and costeffective solutions.

AB  - Collaborative planning is a recognised Lean technique that has been used in the manufacture of building products but less frequently on infrastructure construction projects. It seeks to drive out waste and deliver construction first time, every time. This paper describes the origin and successful implementation of collaborative planning on the complex Borough viaduct project in central London. Successes included a programme saving of 8 weeks within the first 6 months on site, with associated cost savings. It also provided complete buy-in to the project from all involved.

AB  - The construction industry has considerable environmental impacts through the process of manufacturing building materials and building construction. Many environmental labelling programs have been introduced to the construction industry to measure the environmental impacts, including building up the environmental profiles for building materials. Although absolute measurements of the environmental impacts can be obtained by these labelling programs through detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies, relative measurements should not be overlooked to indicate the gap between the current and the "leanest" performance. The term "lean" is often used to describe a process with less wastes, materials, human effort, time, etc. The lean concept originates from the Toyota Production System and has been applied in the automobile industry for decades. This paper therefore aims to investigate the applicability of a relative measurement of the environmental impacts for building materials by introducing the concept of "lean score". The research aim is narrowed down by choosing the carbon labelling program and the precast concrete products as research objectives. The results indicate that a "lean" benchmark can be built to offer relative measurements of carbon emissions for precast concrete products. The lean score obtained from the benchmarking process provides the improving potential that can help the construction industry move towards sustainability. The results are also useful for regulatory bodies to establish national standards to measure the environmental impacts for building materials.

AB  - A growing body of work emerging from the management and organizational studies literature is the Strategy-as-Practice (SaP) perspective, which focuses on the ways in which strategy is actually enacted within organizational settings. This perspective is used to examine the diffusion of lean construction. In recent years lean construction has grown in prominence to become one of the primary performative improvement recipes for the construction sector. However, rather than providing a stable strategy around which more collaborative, intelligent and efficient project-based organizations develop, this research reveals how the lean concept transforms during its journey with unintended organizational consequences. An ethnographic case study, informed by SaP, demonstrates how a lean strategy and its effects on organizational practice and culture cannot be understood separately from material and embodied practices and power effects. As well as contributing to the examination of lean construction practice, the findings show how strategy is enacted within construction organizations and the ensuing effects of social power. A new trajectory is opened for research into strategizing within construction organizations, which provides ways to explore actual practices and spaces where strategizing occurs. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Lean production techniques developed by Toyota Motor Corporation have been widely applied in the manufacturing sector to reduce waste, ensure just-in-time delivery, create effective value streams, and ensure continuous improvement. Over the last two decades, significant efforts have been made to develop the theoretical foundation and practical tools to implement these techniques in the construction process. The construction process is similar to production, in that it involves the assembly of raw materials into a product. The design process, on the other hand, involves conversion of the client's requirements into manufacturing instructions using creativity and technical knowledge. This makes it challenging to implement the principles of lean production directly to design. This technical note presents the techniques used by a midsize industrial construction contractor: purpose built facility, making decisions at the last responsible moment, lean audits, and 5S in the design of industrial projects to encapsulate and implement techniques of lean production in the management of design. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Purpose - Several off-site manufacturing companies in Sweden have attempted to apply lean management to improve process effectiveness and efficiency. A state of continuous improvement is a key goal of lean management, as described in, e.g. Likers 4P model. The aim of this study is to test a method to measure the degree to which lean management principles have been adopted by companies that base their production on off-site manufacturing, as a prerequisite for a sustainable approach to continuous improvement. Design/methodology/approach - A survey is applied as research method, using a questionnaire based on the authors' perceptions of best practices corresponding to each lean management principle. Two questionnaires were distributed to both management and factory production personnel in two off-site manufacturing firms in Sweden. Findings - The Likert scores regarding the degree to which lean principles have been applied in the two studied companies showed similar patterns (and similar differences between the management and production personnel's responses), indicating that the results can be generalised within an off-site construction context. The study shows that continuous improvements must emerge and evolve simultaneously with a focus on processes, people and long-term thinking. Research limitations/implications - In order to obtain more generalised and detailed results a more extensive survey covering several companies, as well as more detailed case studies and more questions regarding each principle, are needed. A multivariate analysis will also scan the material for further dependences. Originality/value - The paper highlights several aspects that are important for management to be aware of when aiming for continuous improvements in off-site manufacturing. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Due to higher manufacturing cost in garment production, high variation in product mix. It is very difficult to sustain in the global market. This paper will focus on customized implementation of Lean tool for minimizing the Work in progress (WIP), line setting time in a Knitted T-shirt Production Industry which in turn reduces the cost of production. Design/Methodology/ Approach: This paper is based on the two fold objective of investigation of Value stream mapping in existing product line and to alter the same with new cellular based layout. Work in Progress (WIP) is analyzed in the sewing room product line of both cases and fluctuation of WIP is investigated through data obtained from sewing room production line Findings: The proposed Value Stream mapping (VSM) through the support of cellular layout reduces the WIP level significantly, which deliver many advantages in garment production system. The reduction in WIP in the production process will increase the profit by 20-25 %from the existing level. Practical Implication: This paper will provide the complete feasibility report for implementation of lean to General Garment manufacturing process particularly knitted manufacturing. Since the Garment construction process contains so much internal as well as external process variation .Customization towards the process will enrich the productivity and ultimately profitability. © 2012 EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.

AB  - In order to embrace the Lean principles, supply chains of service companies (SCSCs) likely have to modify how they manage operations. In this paper, we investigate which could be the main problems that managers of SCSCs may encounter in modifying how they manage operations to be more in line with the Lean approach next to presenting a new framework for the defining characteristics of Lean in service companies. This study generates theory from observations in supply chains of service companies, exploiting the process of inductive construction of theory (Handfield and Melnyk, 1998). The methodology in this paper is the analytical conceptual research (Wacker, 1998). The study highlights four main areas of problems within the supply chains of service companies and some messages for managers willing to implement Lean in such environment.

AB  - Simulation is often used to model production processes with the aim of understanding and improving them. In many cases, however, information produced by simulation is not detailed enough and can be misinterpreted. The use of visualization in combination with simulation can provide project participants with a detailed-level model to prevent misinterpretation of information and to understand the production process. The purpose of this research is to automate the visualization process as a post-simulation tool through sharing interactive information between simulation and visualization. The proposed methodology has been applied to the production line of modular buildings with the output of lean, simulation, and visualization in the form of animation. Based on the new scheduling developed by applying lean principles, a simulation model was built and its output was extracted to an ASCII file to be used as input for visualization. 3D visualization was developed using Maxscript in 3D Studio Max for automation of the visualization process. The proposed methodology has been applied to a case study to illustrate the essential features of the work and its benefits for decision making. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the application of lean construction practices in the construction industry and develop a practical and applicable framework that incorporates Six Sigma rating into the best practices of lean construction. The objective is to help the industry reduce waste and cost, increase effectiveness, and improve quality. Design/methodology/approach - A generic yet practical framework of lean construction is developed using the guidelines of project lean delivery system developed by the Lean Construction Institute (LCI). Applicable lean techniques and Six Sigma rating are integrated into the developed framework. A cyclical look-ahead planning and execution approach is used to implement the lean construction techniques. A set of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) performance indicators is defined to measure performance, set target threshold values, and guide improvement actions.Acase study of the construction industry in Abu Dhabi (AD) is used to clarify the proposed approach and identify its key practical aspects. Findings - Analysis of wastes in AD construction industry reveals 27 types of construction wastes. These wastes were categorized into the seven types of wastes. Defects (errors and corrections) are found to be the most common type of construction waste in the surveyed companies. This calls for integrating Six Sigma rating into the proposed lean construction framework. The other common types of wastes are overprocessing and delays. Lean project management is focused on assessing a set of key performance indictors (KPIs) at the end of each “look-ahead” period. First lean practices are employed during the period and Sigma Rating is assessed at the end of the period along with other KPIs. The proposed LSS-KPIs were able to measure progress and guide improvement. Research limitations/implications - The credibility of the research findings is dependent on the accuracy and reliability of collected data from construction companies. Implementing lean construction techniques within a look-ahead period is not expected to achieve significant project gains in terms of quality, speed, and cost without adopting the overall lean construction framework. Social implications - The work of construction companies largely contributes to the quality and safety of public and society at large through residential and commercial buildings, transportation, and infrastructure projects. Lean construction practices and Six Sigma rating positively impact these important aspects and often result in reducing waste and costs, improving safety, and saving energy resources in construction projects. Originality/value - Research significance stems from the focus on increasing the effectiveness of the construction industry. Research contributions include the development of an applicable lean construction framework that integrates lean construction practices with Six Sigma rating. This contributes to the effort of applying Lean Six Sigma (LSS) in the vital field of construction. This research prescribes a systematic approach for implementing the proposed framework within a cyclical look-ahead period and highlights the practical implications of the proposed approach. Also, the research provides an effective periodic measurement system of project effectiveness based on five LSS key performance indices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Burgers Ergon, a subsidiary company of Heijmans N.V., one of the largest construction companies in The Netherlands, decided to undertake a Lean Six Sigma project to improve employee safety on construction sites. The Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) methodology was used as a framework to execute this improvement project. The project started with a clear definition of the process, as safety involved every employee engaged in physical activities. The best process capturing this part of the organization was the incident registration administration. The first step was to capture this in the Supplier-Input-Process-Output-Client (SIPOC). The next step was to translate the purpose of the project to create ideal work and production circumstances into specific and quantifiable measures, called critical-to-quality measures (CTQs). The first step after defining the CTQs was to collect data to determine the existing behavior and to establish clarity regarding the size of the problem.

AB  - Modelling the flow of systems and interior finishing works in building construction has been hampered by the inability of traditional critical path modelling to reflect features of these works such as uncertainty, instability, non-linear and interrupted value-adding processes and re-entrant flow. Drawing on empirical data collected in a work study of a large residential project, a novel workflow model is proposed that explicitly models the flows of products and crews at a fine-grained level. The overall model includes a trade workflow model with a module for each work-package type, and a project level model in which multiple trade modules are embedded. The model was tested through implementation of a simulation of a prototypical construction project involving seven work-packages performed in a 20-storey residential tower with 120 customized apartments. The modelled flows of crews through the test building reflected the same behavioural features observed in construction projects. The model enables evaluation of the impact of management policies on production flow at different levels of detail. It is useful as a research tool and for future development of construction management software. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper serves as a resource to prefabricated construction managers who are attempting to implement lean thinking to improve their production operations by eliminating waste. Lean is both a general way of thinking and a specific production management approach that emphasizes using less of everything to satisfy the customer by delivering the highest quality at the lowest cost in the shortest time. While providing an overview of lean principles, this paper focuses on two fundamental lean concepts, standardization and continuous flow. To develop these concepts, this paper uses a case-study approach to describe the experiences of a large homebuilder confronted by rising production costs as they migrate wall-building operations from the construction site into a factory. Lean production principles are successfully applied, yielding a 47% increase in productivity and a 25% reduction in lead time. This study also found employee involvement and the supplier relationship as key factors for successful lean implementation. Challenges that limited implementation success and the related lessons learned are also presented. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - When management concepts are introduced in organizations, common problems are lack of enthusiasm and that the concept does not solve the organization's problems. In this article, I argue that a more participative process is to introduce new ideas through broad participation and dialogue between insiders and outsiders in order to increase the level of industrial democracy. However, to be able to do so, the management concept has to be flexible enough to be able to be interpreted in different ways. Dialogue and participation require the actual opportunity to make changes to the original concepts. Most management concepts, however, are inherently flexible by being characterized by interpretative viability. This viability opens up an opportunity for participation. In this article, I will describe a case where such an opportunity was used. © The Author(s) 2011.

AB  - Benchmarking plug-load densities is essential to bypass arbitrary and/or incorrect inputs used in building energy analysis. As more building simulationists play a decision-making role for the design team, they tend to lean on building energy standards and guidelines for preliminary inputs such as plug-load densities. It is necessary for building energy standards and rating systems to implement plug-load density benchmarks to reward design teams in their efforts to reduce plug-load energy use. Using case study buildings, this paper establishes benchmark plug-load densities for K-12 schools under two new categories - classrooms with computers and classrooms without computers. Eighteen K-12 schools including 9 elementary, 2 middle, and 7 high schools are assessed for actual plug-load densities. For the same case study buildings, four existing approaches - NREL, COMNET, ASHRAE 90.1-1989, and Title-24 are evaluated for plug-load densities. Results show under- and over-estimation of plug-load densities over actual densities. The development of benchmark for K-12 schools will pave way for instituting targets for trimming plug-load densities in new and retrofit building projects. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The drive to maintain competitiveness by increasing performance has been an ever-present goal of industries within the global market. Although many industries have benefited from classical quality management programs such as total quality management (TQM), lean production, and six sigma, the construction industry has remained primarily unaffected. This paper analyzes these three popular programs, the basis for their success and failures, and their documented level of susceptibility in the construction industry. These programs are then contrasted to the best value system, an owner-driven quality program that has been tested recently in the construction industry and documented to produce encouraging results. On the basis of the findings, it is proposed that most quality management programs are designed to be instigated by the vendor, by improving the company's ability to deliver a quantifiable, replicable product or service. This is significant because it indicates that although the underlying principles of the classic quality management programs are relevant to all markets, the processes and methods of application may be inappropriate for an industry that dispenses highly diverse or integrated products or services, such as construction. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Buffers have been commonly used as a production strategy to protect construction processes from the negative impact of variability. Construction practitioners and researchers have proposed several buffering approaches for different production situations and contexts. However, these solutions have been impractical for managing buffers. To overcome this, this study proposes a new site methodology for managing work-in-process (WIP) buffer in repetitive projects, on the basis of the reliable commitment model (RCM). RCM is a decision-making tool based on lean principles, which uses statistical models to develop more reliable work plans at the operational level. RCM helps to manage WIP buffer in work plans by using site information and planning reliability indicators that result in improved project performance, such as labor productivity and process progress. A repetitive building project was used as a case study. The main finding was that labor productivity, process progress, and waiting times improved when using larger WIP buffers than those typically used among crews. This shows the potential of RCM as a practical tool to manage WIP buffer sizes and to promote the use of lean production strategies at the operational level. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - 'Lean construction' is becoming a very popular paradigm in the construction industry globally. This paper attempts to analyze whether lean concepts can be applied to Indian construction sites with particular emphasis on above-false-ceiling building services. 'Lean'techniques, such as, the dependency structure matrix (DSM) and value stream analysis (VSM) have been applied to represent and manage the complexities inherent in the design and execution of above false-ceiling building services. Data was collected from four construction projects. A component-based design interface matrix was developed for reducing repetitive component routing iterations in the creation of coordination drawings. In order to improve material and information flow in execution of above false ceiling building services, a value stream analysis was performed. This analysis showed that process re-engineering could lead to a 50% reduction in construction time. The results show that 'Lean' tools and techniques can greatly benefit Indian construction.

AB  - The two biggest challenges in the construction industry, low productivity and high injury rates, may be addressed simultaneously through the combination of lean production strategies and traditional safety-analysis tools. This case study used Safety and Lean Integrated Kaizen (SLIK) in a modular housing manufacturing facility by applying one lean production tool, kaizen, and a safety-analysis tool, job safety analysis (JSA). The research team used SLIK with the base-framing crew, and the method consisted of analyzing the current process, determining and implementing process improvements, and analyzing the improved process. The changes resulted in a 16% increase in value-added activities and increased the framing crew's overall output by 55%. By making quick, low-cost changes that were intended to improve productivity to the station layout and work design, safety and ergonomic hazards, including reduced trip hazards, pinch points, and back strain, were also reduced or eliminated. These results support the hypothesis that productivity and safety can be improved simultaneously through combined lean and safety tools. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Achieving smooth and continual flow of information among teams of independent designers is one of the central difficulties in detailed design of complex civil engineering projects. Lean production flow phenomena such as bottlenecks, rework, large batches and long cycle times are common. This research sought correlation between the degree of success achieved, in terms of design document effectiveness, meeting budget and schedule targets, and participant satisfaction, on the one hand, and the occurrence of information flow problems, on the other. Extensive data describing the communication of design documents between team members were collected in the detailed design phase of 14 civil engineering projects, all of which were part of a major airport construction project. The degree of effectiveness of the design documents, the extent to which budget and schedule targets were met, and participants' evaluations of their success were measured. The results confirm positive correlation between the quality of information flows and the effectiveness of design documents, and confirm that unstable information flows are associated with unpredictable project outcomes. No correlation was found between information flow problems and design managers' subjective views of the processes, nor between their performance evaluations and their fulfilment of budget or schedule targets. © 2011 Earthscan ISSN.

AB  - Value for the customer through efficient production processes is a fundamental principle of lean thinking. In lean construction, value to customers is largely delivered through project planning and control activities only. Thus, it can be argued that lean construction overlooks the opportunity to address value from the early stages of a project. Aimed at improving this, lean design arose as a new approach for design management promoting customer and end user involvement from the early stage of projects. However, even here environmental and social issues are postponed over individual requirements. As a result, lean potential in general skips the opportunity to address value from a wider perspective in which the return of value from the construction industry to society is considered. This paper proposes dividing the wider understanding of the performance of the (global) built environment from the particular (local) project requirements calling the former first value and the latter last value. The theory is triangulated through observation of how a developing country (Chile) is resolving social issues through the use of the built environment. The work described develops lean design management by providing a clearer vision of value to reduce waste and aid sustainability in the built environment. © 2011 Earthscan ISSN.

AB  - This article elaborates on lean thinking in design management. Lean philosophy focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing value. We discuss how lean concepts can be understood and how this can affect the design process. In particular, we examine how flexibility can be achieved through the use of a layered design process and a layered building design. The design process has two main outcomes: input to the production and/or construction process, and input to the decision process. These two outcomes have a number of contradictory characteristics. Traditionally, production processes call for early decisions and control of cost, time and risks. Typically, this has been the engineers' or the contractors' perspective. In contrast, the decision process typically strives to postpone final commitments and design freeze in order to keep options open. Lean thinking shows that the two approaches do not have to be contradictory. Based on case studies of two hospital projects, we discuss flexibility in the design process and design in relation to lean principles. The article demonstrates the importance of seeing the design process and design model as two integrated parts. Lean thinking can serve as an enabler by focusing on reducing waste and increasing the customer's value. © 2011 Earthscan ISSN.

AB  - Waste associated with building design is one of the causes of the high cost and slow progress of construction projects in Ghana. Proper management of waste at the design stage is therefore a fundamental step towards achieving speedy delivery of building projects at minimum cost. This paper seeks to examine the level of awareness of sources of waste and the application of waste reduction tools in the building design process by Ghanaian consultancy firms. Data on the design activities of the firms were collected by distributing questionnaires to consultants, while contractors and clients were interviewed. Involvement in various building design processes was also used to obtain data for the study. Results revealed a generally low recognition of sources of waste in the building design process and little awareness of waste reduction tools such as design structure matrix, batch size reduction and set-based design. It was also found that inadequate familiarity of the firms with lean thinking was among a number of limitations to the application of waste reduction tools in Ghana. This suggests that there is a need to improve the awareness of lean design management in both education and practice in Ghana. © 2011 Earthscan ISSN.

AB  - There has been increased focus on recycling in Sweden during recent years. This focus can be attributed to external environmental factors such as tougher legislation, but also to the potential gains for raw materials suppliers. Recycling centres are important components in the Swedish total recycling system. Recycling centres are manned facilities for waste collection where visitors can bring, sort and discard worn products as well as large-sized, hazardous, and electrical waste. The aim of this paper was to identify and describe the main flows and layout types at Swedish recycling centres. The aim was also to adapt and apply production theory for designing and managing recycling centre operations. More specifically, this means using lean production principles to help develop guidelines for recycling centre design and efficient control. Empirical data for this research was primarily collected through interviews and questionnaires among both visitors and employees at 16 Swedish recycling centres. Furthermore, adapted observation protocols have been used in order to explore visitor activities. There was also close collaboration with a local recycling centre company, which shared their layout experiences with the researchers in this project. The recycling centres studied had a variety of problems such as queues of visitors, overloading of material and improper sorting. The study shows that in order to decrease the problems, the recycling centres should be designed and managed according to lean production principles, i.e. through choosing more suitable layout choices with visible and linear flows, providing better visitor information, and providing suitable technical equipment. Improvements can be achieved through proper planning of the layout and control of the flow of vehicles, with the result of increased efficiency and capacity, shorter visits, and cleaner waste fractions. The benefits of a lean production mindset include increased visitor capacity, waste flexibility, improved sorting quality, shorter time for visits and improved working conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose This study maintains that there is a need for proper execution of coordination mechanisms as a means to reduce waste. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between the coordination of activities and resources on the one hand, and the occurrence of different types of waste on the other. Design/methodology/approach The empirical context of this paper is a case study at a Swedish construction company that has applied the industrialised housing concept; a concept which has increased in popularity in recent years. The core concept of industrialised housing means that houses are (more or less) pre-manufactured in specific production units, i.e. factories, and thereafter assembled on-site. Findings The analysis highlights the importance of having the right type as well as the right amount of coordination. In addition, obstacles and challenges for proper coordination are discussed. Originality/value Even if not all waste can be explained and eliminated by appropriate coordination, this research shows that coordination theory provides lean researchers with a new tool for analysis of the supply chain and how waste can be eliminated. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to hypothesize that value-driven purchasing of customized kitchen cabinets is more profitable than market-driven purchasing in industrialised housing construction. The hypothesis is examined through a case study of kitchen carpentry at one of the Sweden's largest producers of industrialised prefabricated multi-storey housing. By comparing characteristics of market- vs value-driven purchasing, this paper aims to further clarify the benefits and drawbacks of these two strategies. Design/methodology/approach By comparing characteristics of market- vs value-driven purchasing, a theoretical framework is proposed that clarifies the benefits and drawbacks of the two strategies. An explorative case study of kitchen carpentry at a house manufacturer illustrates purchasing of kitchen cabinets in the industrialised housing industry in relation to the proposed framework. Findings The case study results indicate that, from a value perspective, a long-term relationship with a dedicated local smaller supplier is a preferable choice over a short-term relationship with a low-price mass producer. Research limitations/implications This is a single case study that should be verified by further empirical work of a test delivery from the local sub-system manufacturer. Such a study would provide more insights into this area of work and make it possible to thoroughly evaluate potential risks. The indicative results in this paper can be made conclusive through quantification of the proposed lean purchasing characteristics. Originality/value A comparison of value- and market-driven purchasing is carried out in theory and applied to a real case study that brings new perspectives to purchasing. In this way, the paper proposes alternative purchasing strategies to the construction industry. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop two hypotheses explaining the role of commercial management in the lean business model: lean construction is a viable choice of commercial strategy; and lean commercial management is an integral part of lean construction system subordinate to the project delivery. This is completed as a part of conceptualisation of the lean commercial management discipline in construction on the abstract level and followed by deriving its main principles. Design/methodology/approach The research is based on the direct observation of the companies pursuing lean strategy in construction as well as of those following non-lean business models, review of case studies and literature. Findings Traditional commercial arrangements do not comply with the lean construction requirements and may hamper the exploration of its full potential. Lean commercial management differs in the way that its primary role is to support the production process thus it is subordinated to it. Research limitations/implications This research would benefit from links with the existent field of social and economic studies where deeper reasoning to substantiate the theory might be found. Experiments with lean companies in the construction sector are also necessary for theory validation. Practical implications The approach offered in this paper vectors the way of dealing with the commercial decisions within lean enterprise. This potentially can further enhance benefits from lean construction. Originality/value The paper builds upon the related research and papers, further advancing the topic of lean construction. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Purpose Lean projects seek to optimise the project rather than its parts and to maximize value to the customer. To better align the behaviour of project participants with a Lean project delivery model, the purpose of this paper is to argue for compensation structures that better address the economic and non-economic motives that impact project performance. Design/methodology/approach Social science research increasingly shows that non-economic human motives play a key role in job performance and that they interact in complicated ways with economic incentives. By reviewing and extrapolating from relevant literature, this paper explores certain key non-economic human motives and their impact on project performance, how these non-economic motives interact with economic incentives, and strategies for structuring effective incentives. Findings The paper identifies certain contract incentive principles that the authors believe should promote non-economic motivation. Research limitations/implications The paper provides a starting point for further research regarding compatibility of incentives with non-economic motives on Lean projects. In particular, more research is needed on the applicability of the social science findings to corporate entities. Practical implications The paper suggests that traditional compensation systems are ill-suited to project-optimised behaviour. Originality/value This paper provides important insight into the problems of traditional compensation systems for construction projects and offers both concepts and strategies that could better align economic incentives with project-optimised behaviour. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Purpose – Lean construction enhances cooperative project delivery with a focus on customer needs and the optimization of the project as a whole rather than pieces during the design phase, as well as, during construction. The purpose of this paper is to show that by using the lean approach, project results will be positively influenced by a cooperative project delivery, in the areas of cost, time and quality. Also, the full application of the lean cooperative model is limited by strict design-bid-build tender regulations required for public clients. Design/methodology/approach – The existing lean project delivery system in the USA and the corresponding contract – the integrated form of agreement – and, the Australian alliance agreements have been analysed. The main focus of the analysis has been to identify the fundamental characteristics and factors of success concerning a cooperative project delivery. As a result, a lean system which includes the key parts for cooperative project delivery from the client's perspective will be presented in this paper. It identifies which procurement rules are impediments to early cooperation and – hence – would have to be modified. The reasons for those modifications are given on the basis of the case studies. Findings – It was difficult to compare the results of different projects and to allocate the influence of different tools to the outcomes in terms of cost, time and quality. Originality/value – A matrix has been developed that measures qualitative results and correlates it to the use of the tools and is presented in the paper. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - ASCE's Vision 2025 report conceptualizes civil engineering as entrusted by society to create a sustainable world and enhance the global quality of life and civil engineers serving competently, collaboratively, and ethically. The implied transformation requires the integration of separate production and delivery steps across a supply chain typically consisting of several suppliers. Grown out of lean engineering since the 1950s, the philosophy of Purpose, Process, People has made its way out of its original automotive industry application into virtually all production and service industries. This philosophy builds on (1)a clear articulation of the purpose of an organization internally and along the supply chain, (2)the processes required to support this purpose along the supply chain, and (3)the people needed to execute and act on these purposes and support these processes. In support of the above transformation outcome, integration along the supply chain is critical in order to deliver maximum value to the customer. The authors present a South African case study in which a lean approach to implement Purpose, Process, People in a live road construction environment ahead of a global sports event was pursued. Tactics are summarized and lessons learned are discussed. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Justification for research The construction companies are facing barriers and challenges in BIM adoption as there is no clear guidance or best practice studies from which they can learn and build up their capacity for BIM use in order to increase productivity, efficiency, quality, and to attain competitive advantages in the global market and to achieve the targets in environmental sustainability. Purpose: This paper aims to explain a comprehensive and systemic evaluation and assessment of the relevant BIM technologies as part of the BIM adoption and implementation to demonstrate how efficiency gains have been achieved towards a lean architectural practice. Design/methodology/approach The research is undertaken through a KTP (Knowledge Transfer Partnership) project between the University of Salford and the John McCall Architects based in Liverpool, which is an SME (Small Medium Enterprise). The overall aim of KTP is to develop a lean design practice through the BIM adoption and implementation. The overall BIM implementation approach uses a socio-technical view in which it does not only consider the implementation of technology but also considers the socio-cultural environment that provides the context for its implementation. The technology adoption methodology within the BIM implementation approach is the action research oriented qualitative and quantitative research for discovery, comparison, and experimentation as the KTP project with JMA provides an environment for "learning by doing". Findings: Research has proved that BIM technology adoption should be undertaken with a bottom-up approach rather than top-down approach for successful change management and dealing with the resistance to change. As a result of the BIM technology adoption, efficiency gains are achieved through the piloting projects and the design process is improved through the elimination of wastes and value generation. Originality/value: Successful BIM adoption needs an implementation strategy. However, at operational level, it is imperative that professional guidelines are required as part of the implementation strategy. This paper introduces a systematic approach for BIM technology adoption based on a case study implementation and it demonstrates a guideline at the operational level for other architectural companies of architectural practices. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The lean construction concept has been introduced successfully into the construction industry to reduce construction wastes. While lean concepts require a rethinking of existing construction processes and practices, there is also a need for new tools to implement lean thinking. In addition, while lean can improve project time and cost performance, it may also have an impact on sustainability, which mainly focuses on reducing environmental impact of construction. This paper describes the implementation of lean construction and its implication on environmental sustainability from a contractor perspective through a case study. The study observed waste in both project-level contractor coordination and operationlevel construction performance. A vertically-integrated scheduling system that features location-based look-ahead scheduling and graphic weekly work planning was developed to improve project-level contractor coordination. To implement waste elimination solutions at the operation level, construction simulation and 3-D visualization were applied to facilitate lean implementation. Meanwhile, the impact of lean on sustainability were observed and discussed.

AB  - Construction submittals are items that the contractor sends to the project engineer in the construction field office for review and approval. Problems arise when the construction schedule is negatively impacted because submittals are either received late, incomplete, or deficient from the contractor. A lean tool, value stream mapping (VSM), and various other lean concepts were used to analyze the submittal review process for a typical levee construction project. Through the application of lean concepts, measurable savings in process and lead times are obtainable by reducing or eliminating nonvalue activities. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The general approach within lean construction is to make the construction process as it is normally undertaken on the construction site and leaner by reducing non-value generating activities. The reason on why the lean principles are used into rapid construction is to solve the chronicle and congested activities within the time frame of the rapid construction projects. Five principles of lean were made into comparison in the review of three case studies. In many applications of construction concept, the use of rapid construction method components significantly decreased the construction time required for the project. The most significant benefit has been seen in areas where systems have been using it repeatedly. The benefits from lean principles into rapid construction are the shorten of order fulfillment leading times, less project downtime, more innovation and true reduce the chronicle predecessor. This research has also identified eight critical factors of integrating lean with rapid construction that are proven successful which are planning it right, understanding the whole life construction cycle in non price factor view, utilize knowledge and expertise, integrate the team by working with the end to end supply chain in an integrated manner, understand the end to end process, measure performance to include reporting in your own performance, training and benchmarking. © Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.

AB  - One of the primary concerns in the lean construction community has been understanding and managing the combined impact of variability and interdependency on construction performance. The parade game has been extensively utilised for enhancing construction practitioners' intuitive understanding of construction production systems. However, the current parade game does not incorporate managerial actions that are usually taken in practice to offset the impact of variability of activity duration or productivity. These managerial actions often radically change the production profile (e.g., quantity of resources, level of production capacity); thereby significantly affecting project performance. For this reason, exclusion of managerial actions in the parade game can result in less realistic estimation of project performance. Also, given that the pedagogical value of a simulation-based game can be maximised by user interaction, managerial actions are a key element that should be incorporated in the parade game. Based on this recognition, this paper aims to develop an interactive simulation game as an extension of the current parade game. For application in the construction education setting, this game incorporates managerial decision making processes and highlights trade-offs associated with managerial decision. Being developed as an Internet-based application which can be accessed through any platform, the interactive parade game has been applied in construction education. Its application showed that the interactive parade game can successfully help students to actively participate in the learning processes and discuss their findings, and to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of construction production systems. © 2011 The authors.

AB  - A lean-agile model of homebuilders' production systems is proposed in this research. Value stream mapping is utilized to clarify the proposed lean-agile model, in which pull and Kanban are used to ensure smooth production upstream of the de-coupling point, while fluctuating market demands in terms of variety of homes and variability of volumes are managed by the agile process downstream of the de-coupling point. The decoupling point is used to provide components to downstream agile process and shield upstream smooth production from market fluctuations. A simulation model is developed to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed lean-agile model. Simulation experiments show that the lean-agile model prevents the accumulation of high inventory levels and thus provides better customization opportunities for clients compared to even-flow-construction. It also provides a more stable process with shorter cycle times compared to sales-driven production. The proposed lean-agile model offers new possibilities for homebuilders to manage the balance between meeting fluctuating market demands and stabilizing the production system. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study advances a critical re-conceptualization of 'diversity' through class. Drawing on the case of CarCo, the Belgian branch of a North American automobile company, I show how the discursive constructions of various socio-demographic identities reflect underlying class relations between labour and capital and are, in turn, implicated in their reproduction. Reflecting the instrumental conceptualization of labour as the source of economic value in the capitalist mode of production, female, older and disabled workers were discursively constructed as unable or unwilling to perform as expected within the factory lean production system. These negative identities in turn legitimized the elimination of 'different' workers in the company restructuring and the outsourcing of the phases of the production process that could be carried out by them, materially reproducing class relations. The analysis unveils the 'dark' business case against diversity at CarCo, a company which was renowned as a 'best' case for diversity in Belgium. I argue that the re-conceptualization of diversity through class offers a powerful analytical tool to better understand how unequal power relations are played out in contemporary organizations. © The Author(s) 2011.

AB  - Prefabrication and just-in-time (JIT) delivery are important components of a lean supply system. Past research focuses on how much lead time is reduced and how much costs are saved, but few have studied the environmental impacts. While most of those studies on environmental impacts have focused on select life cycle phases or specific building materials and components, the impacts of different construction methods or supply strategies from the construction phase were ignored or simply approximated. This paper presents the results of a case on the environmental impacts of prefabrication and JIT delivery strategy of rebar supply on a high-rise condominium project in Korea. © 2010 ASCE.

AB  - Practitioners and regulators increasingly rely on economic theory to measure bank efficiency and liken institutes with each other. These studies lean first on several methods that could be either stochastic or deterministic and second the input-output definition is based on a production or intermediation approach. This restraining modeling is unaware of several factors that can influence meaningfully banking efficiency such as banks' corporate governance. This paper aims to build a new model to measure bank efficiency. The goal of our model is to remedy existing model failings by the incorporation of the governance system. Our new model results imply contributions at both theoretical and empirical levels. From theoretical point of view, we develop an index to measure corporate governance productivity in the banking industry. This index is obtained by incorporating the governance variables in the usual expression of the directional technology distance function and a new development of the Luenberger productivity indicator. At empirical level, We apply this model on 146 banks dispersed in ten European countries. We show a significant effect of the governance variables on the construction of the technology frontier. In addition we find that the governance systems of Italy, Luxemburg and Netherlands are the more productive than the other systems. © 2010, Banking and Finance Review.

AB  - This paper conceptualises four different states of the construction supply chain (fragmented supply markets, process integration, work clusters, and pools of suppliers) as the result of intersecting two strategic dimensions: industrial 'modes' (i.e., from project to process) and the extent of integration in which partnership exists (i.e., from less to highly integrated supply chain). Improvement methodologies such as TQM and lean thinking provide management philosophy, methods and tools to improve the performance of the construction supply chain towards its 'ideal' practice (value creation). Since benchmarking is an important mechanism for managing performance in the construction industry, the actors in a construction supply chain need to identify and develop relevant value-related (performance) measures and their impacts on gaining/maintaining partners' trust and their willingness to collaborate.

AB  - Lean production has transformed into applications loosely called Lean Thinking and spread to areas such as health care, construction, distribution and service industry. Lean Thinking looks at the value chain and posits: How can work be structured so that the function under consideration does nothing but add value, and does that as rapidly as possible? This paper examines broader interpretation and adaptation of Lean Thinking to adult education. Applying Lean Thinking practices to course design and delivery requires instructors to challenge current views regarding how and what they teach. Some examples of application are suggested. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Purpose - Contractors adopt various strategies to achieve their firms' objectives of continued existence and further development, and to guide the relationship between the firms and the business environment within which they operate. An economic recession drives firms to undertake unusual steps to survive within an environmental context. The purpose of this paper is to examine the survival strategies of Singapore contractors in the eight years of unprecedented recession in the industry from 1997 to 2005 are examined. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 34 interviews were conducted with senior executives of large and medium-sized construction firms in Singapore to identify their survival strategies during the recession period. Findings - Three categories of strategies are identified: contracting-related actions, cost-control related actions, and financial-related actions. The results show that most contractors opted to bid for more projects that are within their firms' resources and capabilities in contracting for jobs. To control cost, all contractors implemented stricter site management on material wastage, stricter financial management on firms' cash flow, stricter and procurement procedures. The majority of them froze salaries and stopped hiring. In order to remain solvent, most contractors set aside a sum of money from their reserves for unforeseen circumstances. Practical implications - Contractors should learn how to stay adequately lean in managing their business in order to be flexible and responsive to changes within the business environment. The findings highlight the importance of effective cost, risk, relationship and resource management. Originality/value - The findings provide valuable lessons to construction firms in preparing for volatile market conditions during a recession. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Commitment planning reliability at an operational level is a key factor for improving project performance. In the last 15 years, the Last Planner System, a production planning and control system based on lean production principles, has improved commitment planning reliability in the construction industry. However, many construction decision makers continue to rely on their experience and intuition when planning their commitments, which hinders their reliability. The reliable commitment model (RCM) is proposed to improve commitment planning reliability at the operational level by using statistical models. RCM is an operational decision-making tool based on lean principles that supports short-term forecasting commitment planning using common-site information such as workers, buffers, and plans. RCM was tested in several case studies, demonstrating its production forecasting capabilities and its ability to help increase commitment planning reliability and improve project performance. RCM also supports workload and labor capacity matching decisions. RCM has the potential of becoming a useful production decision-making tool. © 2010 ASCE.

AB  - While the current global economy can be characterized by the intensification of business competitiveness, leaner organizations, the convergence of products and services, and by vast technological developments, the risks and uncertainties inherent in such a dynamic environment make the management of organizational knowledge even more crucial. Indeed, previous theoretical and empirical-based studies have proven that knowledge leads to organizational success. Knowledge Management (KM) has particularly gained credence, and continues to generate interest, in academic and business circles. KM is of especial interest to project-based industries such as construction, as the effective management of knowledge is critical to the survival and continued advancement of a company. In fact, in the construction industry, the implementation of a knowledge management system (KMS) is currently being considered, and an increasing number of companies have already proposed knowledge management initiatives. However, quality of information must take precedence over quantity, especially in the developmental phases of this KMS. Therefore, how to filter and accurately evaluate quantitative and qualitative data becomes a significant challenge. Yet, thus far, only a few studies examining the improvement of knowledge evaluation have been conducted and that researches only focus on the evaluation methods. This research addresses these issues by focusing on knowledge management and evaluation and by specifically addressing how to evaluate knowledge effectively. Based on the Active Knowledge Management, this study proposes a process model for effectual construction knowledge evaluation using Expert Index (EI). EI is the level of specialty workers achieve in a certain field after engaging in a knowledge activity. The proposed model will not only enable precise evaluation, but will also provide stimulating knowledge activities; thus, if practically applied, this model could enhance actual organizational success.

AB  - Purpose: Improving construction supply chain collaboration and performance is central for achieving short-term business objectives as well as long-term competitive advantage. Lean thinking is an approach that has been adopted in many different industrial settings as a means for improving supply chain performance. In the project-based construction industry, lean thinking has, however, not yet been widely adopted. The purpose of this paper is to increase the understanding of how various aspects of lean thinking can be implemented in a construction project and how they affect supply chain actors and their performance. Design/methodology/approach: Action research was performed in a case study of a lean construction pilot project. Empirical data were collected through three surveys and follow-up workshops, document studies, and interviews of 12 project participants. Findings: The findings show that many of the lean-related aspects identified in the literature review were utilized in the pilot project. These aspects have mostly focused on increasing the cooperation among supply chain actors, for which reason the pilot project is very similar to a partnering project. Hence, much work remains in order to obtain full-fledged lean construction, but the pilot project may serve as a starting point for continuous improvements and development of lean construction in future projects. Research limitations/implications: The research results are based on one empirical case study for which reasonable generalisations could be made, albeit cautiously. Practical implications: The frame of reference can serve as an illustration of important aspects and core elements of lean construction and the case study findings show how various lean related aspects can be implemented and how they affect supply chain actors and their performance in a construction project context. Originality/value: The action research approach based on both qualitative and quantitative data collection in a lean construction pilot project provides a valuable opportunity to study both the process of implementing lean construction and its outcomes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Lean construction and building information modeling (BIM) are quite different initiatives, but both are having profound impacts on the construction industry. A rigorous analysis of the myriad specific interactions between them indicates that a synergy exists which, if properly understood in theoretical terms, can be exploited to improve construction processes beyond the degree to which it might be improved by application of either of these paradigms independently. Using a matrix that juxtaposes BIM functionalities with prescriptive lean construction principles, 56 interactions have been identified, all but four of which represent constructive interaction. Although evidence for the majority of these has been found, the matrix is not considered complete but rather a framework for research to explore the degree of validity of the interactions. Construction executives, managers, designers, and developers of information technology systems for construction can also benefit from the framework as an aid to recognizing the potential synergies when planning their lean and BIM adoption strategies. © 2010 ASCE.

AB  - Smooth flow of production in construction is hampered by disparity between individual trade teams' goals and the goals of stable production flow for the project as a whole. This is exacerbated by the difficulty of visualizing the flow of work in a construction project. While the addresses some of the issues in Building information modeling provides a powerful platform for visualizing work flow in control systems that also enable pull flow and deeper collaboration between teams on and off site. The requirements for implementation of a BIM-enabled pull flow construction management software system based on the Last Planner System™, called 'KanBIM', have been specified, and a set of functional mock-ups of the proposed system has been implemented and evaluated in a series of three focus group workshops. The requirements cover the areas of maintenance of work flow stability, enabling negotiation and commitment between teams, lean production planning with sophisticated pull flow control, and effective communication and visualization of flow. The evaluation results show that the system holds the potential to improve work flow and reduce waste by providing both process and product visualization at the work face. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, most management approaches coming from engineering focus on the external world, i.e. everything that can be seen (structures-processes-outcome). This situation has created low sustainability for these management approaches and tools, because they forget central aspects of people behavior both in individual and collective domains. Therefore, some efforts to integrate the organization's inner and outer world have been carried out, in order to design the organization's inner world (personality-emotionality-values-culture) as a space that facilitates the incorporation of effective management practices focused on the external world, such as lean construction. This article describes and discusses the revolutionary theory of integral vision proposed by Ken Wilber, as a framework that embraces different insights, theories and practices in such a manner that strengthens the discipline of project management under the lean construction perspective. A production planning and control tool termed Last Planner System, which was based on lean construction principles, is used to illustrate the impact of integral vision over lean construction and project management. As a conclusion, it can be argued that if lean construction wants to evolve towards an effective management practice, the inclusion of some elements of the integral vision is needed, in order to make human and technical development inside the organization or project compatible. To achieve the above, lean construction must strengthen those research areas related to people, which so far has received little attention.

AB  - As competition intensifies, many enterprises take drastic measures to sustain their competitive advantages. One of these measures is lean production system that was first introduced in the 1990. The purpose of this study is to apply lean production principles to precast fabrication. This study first describes the origin and concepts, specifically the 14 management principles and 4P models of lean production system to pinpoint how this system can be applied. Then two of these principles are applied on precast plant management by using fuzzy logic. A real case is examined using the proposed method. The result from this study demonstrates that applying lean production system in precast fabrication can reduce waste and increase values for customers. © Medwell Journals, 2010.

AB  - Waste in engineering design has many facets, from partial utilization of the solution space, to wasteful management of design resources, and creation of erroneous and ineffective design documents. In the detailed construction documentation design phase of construction projects with teams comprising multiple independent designers, slow and interrupted information flows lead to significant waste. Applying lean principles, such as reducing batch sizes, cycle times and work in progress inventories, to the management of information flows may improve processes and reduce waste in this phase of the design process, but the lack of a method for measuring the volume, rate and effectiveness of information flow is an obstacle to research. This study proposes measuring the flow of information in the process of detailed design where construction documents are prepared. Measures and indices of flow were formulated based on examination of empirical data compiled by monitoring flows of design information in the detailed design stage of each of fourteen construction projects. Data describing the flows was drawn from the database logs created through practitioners' use of a project extranet service. Indices for identifying information flow bottlenecks, large batch sizes and accumulation of work in process were computed and validated for four of the projects by comparing them with the results of independent observations of design coordination meetings. An index for measuring rework was also computed but could not be validated. The indices and information flow graphs are intended to assist in identifying faults or bottlenecks in the process either as they happen or in retrospective study, indicating disruptions in the information flow. As such, they are important tools for research of engineering design and may be of practical use in design management if incorporated in future online design management tools. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

AB  - Labor constraints and schedule pressures are common in periods of high market growth. Such conditions can have a significant impact on project performance. However, the extent to which such conditions impact the project depends on the effectiveness of the production control system. This case study analyzes the performance problems on a large residential project with significant labor constraints. The case first describes how the combination of labor shortage, high workload, and quality problems caused extensive workflow disruptions and schedule delays. Then, the analysis discusses why the production control system (the way the work assignments are planned, coordinated, and released for execution) failed to effectively manage these problems. The case is based on data from nine single-family houses in a large residential development. To evaluate the production control system, the authors used lean construction metrics and collected detailed data on the activities completed every week, the activities that were not completed as planned for that week, and the reasons for not completion. At the completion of the units, the researchers tracked the cycle time and evaluated the effect of the production control problems on the delays. The findings illustrate that, on projects with labor constraints, it is critical that the production control system focuses on creating reliable work assignments and minimizing quality defects in order to prevent further disruptions and make the best possible utilization of the limited labor resources. © 2010 ASCE.

AB  - Analysis of historical projects, with the dual benefits of hindsight and modern concepts of construction systems, can help fill the gaps in our theoretical understanding of production in construction, which have increasingly been identified as a barrier to progress in improving construction project management. The richness of the historical record describing construction of the Empire State Building provides a unique opportunity to analyze and compare it with the paradigms of craft, industrialized, and lean construction. Its size and its record rate of construction, which has not been broken since for tall buildings, make it of prime interest. The project progress was reconstructed using line-of-balance software and its different flows were assessed. The results lead to the conclusion that it is an archetypal example of what we propose be called "mass construction." This enables a richer understanding of the taxonomy of production systems in construction, and should aid theoreticians and practitioners alike to devise better production systems for construction projects. © 2010 ASCE.

The scope of this study is to examine the naval construction process from design to implementation, with special emphasis on the role of design sharing and constructability. We use the System Dynamics methodology to model the construction process and conduct simulations to examine the impact of project management decisions. We conclude that increased constructability efforts and design sharing mitigate the impact of cost over-runs and project completion delays, and that when limited resources exist it is best to focus improvement efforts early rather than later.

AB  - This paper describes the construction of two major cablestayed bridges on the 8·2 km long US$2·5 billion fixed link connecting Busan to Geoje Island on Korea's south coast. The 1·65 km two-pylon and the 1·87 km three-pylon cable-stayed bridges cross water depths of up to 30 m with main spans of 475 m and 2 × 230 m, respectively. The alignment takes an island-hopping route that is exposed to severe open sea conditions from the Pacific Ocean. To minimise off-shore working, large precast concrete units were used extensively for the sub-structures. This included placing 9600 t caissons, 1800 t pier shafts and 2080 t pier cross beams by floating crane. The prefabricated approach bridge superstructure spans up to 90 m long and 2427 t were also placed by floating crane. The pylons for the bridges are up to 158 m high and have a distinctive curved elevation. From the caisson, the two legs splay outwards until they reach the cross beam at deck level, where they lean back towards each other while both forming a large-radius curve. This imposes additional complexity on the construction but is considered to give enhanced appearance. Unusually, the deck has no vertical bearings at the pylon locations, instead being supported entirely by the cable stays. During superstructure construction, five sets of balanced cantilevers will be in simultaneous use and temporary typhoon stabilising measures will be the major risk management challenge. Completion is due in December 2010.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the production processes utilized by the global construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: This paper discusses the history of the construction industry with a specific focus on the evolution of lean production systems (LPSs) that has a significant impact in reduction of waste in the light of operational performance. The paper proceeds through a comparison of the differences between construction and manufacturing processes. Findings: The construction industry consumes large amounts of natural resources along with wastage due to inefficient and improper utilization. Numerous factors contribute to this poor performance, but an efficient means of identification and reduction of waste has always been left aside. A fully integrated LPS is a way to eliminate much waste in the construction process. Originality/value: This paper has developed an instrument to measure degree of integration of LPS principles in the construction industry that can be used globally. It can be used as a checklist for what to aim at when trying to implement LPS in construction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Job Safety Analysis (JSA), which is also known as Job Hazard Analysis, is an efficient proactive measure for safety risk assessment used in industrial manufacturing settings. However, unlike the manufacturing settings for which JSA was developed, at construction sites the physical environment is constantly changing, workers move through the site in the course of their work, and they are often endangered by activities performed by other teams. To address this difficulty, a structured method for hazard analysis and assessment for construction activities, called "Construction Job Safety Analysis" (CJSA), was developed. The method was developed within the framework of research toward a lean approach to safety management in construction, which required the ability to predict fluctuating safety risk levels in order to support safety conscious planning and pulling of safety management efforts to the places and times where they are most effective. The method involves identification of potential loss-of-control events for detailed stages of the activities commonly performed in construction, and assessment of the probability of occurrence for each event identified. It was applied to explore 14 primary construction activities in an extensive trial implementation that included expert workshops and a series of 101 interviews with site engineers and superintendents. Detailed quantitative results were obtained for a total of 699 possible loss-of-control events; the most frequent events are those related to exterior work at height. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - If client values are not fully understood in a construction project it is likely to result in either low fulfilment of client expectations or multiple design alterations during the project process which lead to additional costs and frustration among the project participants. However, it is not a straightforward management task to operationalize client value in construction. Within this context, the client group comprises multiple stakeholders, which often have conflicting goals and values that may not be fully realized by the stakeholders themselves. The management challenge is further complicated by the fact that the delivery team, which is responsible for understanding and delivering client value, is made up of even more different parties. The article reports the initial outcome of a joint research project between academics and practitioners, which aims to develop a practical workshop model that incorporates client values into the conceptual design of construction projects. The workshop model draws on value management and lean thinking as underlying principles in an attempt to address the ambiguous concept of 'value'. ©2010 Earthscan.

AB  - To enhance competition in the construction industry, EU policies have created and harmonised functional building codes. Moreover, many actors advocate the construction industry moves towards a lean production, process-based way of working for quality and cost reasons. Here, Timber Framed Engineering approaches are considered to have a competitive and environmental advantage. There is however underlying concerns that conservatism in the construction industry, and lack of timber engineering skills, may be obstacles to change. This paper therefore assesses whether EU construction policy innovation contributed to innovation at the firm level. Timber framed innovators in six European countries were identified, and their sources of innovation assessed. The results indicate that timber framed firms have become actors in the construction industry. Firms have made product, process and organisation innovations. All case firms have similar sources for innovation. The common factor that triggers the firms to innovate is business opportunities that arise from demographic changes in the environment outside the firm, such as environmental sustainability and affordable housing for lower income groups. To address these opportunities, the case firms implicitly recognised that traditional project and site-based construction approaches are an incongruity. The firms have consequently established in-house prefabrication, including developed of lean production processes to ensure quality as well as effectiveness. The firms have all recognised that a fundamental barrier to their business was the lack of timber framed engineering competencies in their customers' organisations. Accordingly, a business necessity for the case firms was developing construction design competencies. Firms benefited from governmental policy instruments that support timber framed R&D and knowledge transfer. However, firms also gained new knowledge from their own experiences, which they also use in their operations. Accordingly, policy instruments are not a sole or dominant source for innovation in the case firms. Nonetheless, the change in building codes has been a pre-requisite the firms' commercial developments. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Agile methods have proven successful in increasing customer satisfaction and decreasing time and cost to market under uncertain conditions. Key characteristics of agile methods are lean, flexibility and highly iterative development with a strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement. Today construction firms in general and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular are surviving in a drastic competitive environment in which they are facing more and more challenges. Additional innovation is needed in the construction sector, with increased participation from more competitive SMEs. The main purpose of this paper is to present a model to prioritize available management systems to help SMEs address the challenge of today's market competition more effectively. Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology used is that of interpretative case study and grounded theory based on a strong empirical foundation, on which new theoretical insight into knowledge management as an autonomous action is developed. The paper looks at ways by which SMEs are managed, based on the empirical data collected from 12 case studies. It presents the empirical findings drawn from the case studies. Finally, the adoption of agile methods is subjectively assessed as to its potential contribution for improving the business processes of small and medium construction firms. Findings: It is assessed that agile methods offers considerable potential for application in construction SMEs and that there are significant hurdles to its adoption in the actual phase. Should these be overcome, agile methods offers benefits well beyond any individual company. Practical implications: Construction firms need to be aware of the advantages of new management paradigms and practices. The analysis shows that SMEs in the construction sector have to internalize agile values into their business processes to reap the benefits of agile methods. It also reveals that existing practices show some kind of agile flavours. Originality/value: Agile principles and methods are explored, including: philosophy, values, practices and benefits. The management approaches used by construction SMEs are analyzed and discussed. The paper presents recommendations and insights for enhancing the performance and efficiency of SMEs by adopting agile values in their business processes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Over the past few decades there has been extensive reorganization of the construction industry in many developed countries including removal of head contractor companies from direct operational construction, elongation of the subcontracting chain, rising self-employment, casualization of work and reduced investment in training. These trends are the subject of a prescriptive, industry literature directed at industry 'improvement' and an important British-based critique of the underlying drivers of 'leanness' and organizational 're-engineering'. Drawing primarily upon interviews with organizations across the breadth of the industry, this paper provides evidence concerning such key changes in the Australian context, revealing both 'leaning'/'re-engineering' tendencies but also counter-tendencies necessitated by the goal of sustaining enduring enterprise and a viable labour force. A more reflexive approach by major companies to competitive pressures and risk shifting is revealed. Further, this evidence provides grounds for challenging the re-engineering/lean construction critique which is discerned as succumbing to the unitarist and unilinear discourse which it seeks to challenge. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This work presents the results of a PhD thesis that seeks to prove that the principles of lean construction applied to situations of professional qualification in buildings sites bring benefits for the work processes oriented by this paradigm. For this, the work starts from a new categorization of the lean concepts, which was created in an evolutionary way (evolved) from the teachings of Womack and Jones, Koskella and Ghinato, proposing to emphasize managerial actions connected to six main areas, which are: cycle, flow, process coordination, value, continuous improvement and quality of life at work. These elements are presented in form of programs for training courses for professionals of the civil construction industry. To the evaluation of the proposed method a qualitative research was conducted through the application of a questionnaire in many managerial levels of the participating company. As a result, it can be verified that the application of the experiment proved the feasibility of facilitating teaching/learning situations mediated by the principles of the lean construction.

AB  - The Castle, a long-term collaboration between the School of Architecture & Design and local youth-service organizations, intends to assist youth at risk of homelessness by deploying micro-dwellings to households experiencing spatial and emotional distress. Responding to a demonstrated gap in the housing market, the brief for The Castle demands a dwelling that is small, mobile, autonomous and spatially clever. Aside from important social and pedagogical agendas The Castle explores 'leanness' in timber construction. Three prototypes have resulted in 'panitecture,' a highly adaptive construction system composed of CNC-router cut folded plate plywood wall panels integrated with built-in furniture. Panitecture results in an overall reduction in material waste, direct applicability to a low-skilled workforce and opportunities for mass-customisation, accommodating infinite design configurations to be processed without the need for continual redesign. Options are also available for deployment onto site-as a digital file, as individual components, assembled panels, an assembled carcass or as a completed dwelling.

AB  - Implementation of advanced production management techniques, such as lean construction concepts like filtering of work packages to stabilize work flows, pull flow of teams and materials, and in-process quality control, demands effective and timely flows of information both to and from the workface. The key requirement-making the process state transparent to all participants-is more difficult to achieve in construction than in manufacturing, because work crews move continuously within a physical environment that is itself changing. Novel computer-aided visualization tools can fulfill the needs that simpler tools, such as Kanban cards, fulfill in manufacturing. Two prototypes with user interfaces designed to facilitate process flow have been devised and implemented within the context of building information modeling (BIM) software systems. They demonstrate aspects of the synergy between BIM and lean construction. Given the dynamic and dispersed physical environments and the fractured contracting arrangements typical of construction, BIM-based visualization interfaces are important tools for providing process transparency. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - The procurement process is critical for construction companies. To improve it, many are resorting to e-marketplaces although they usually do not know exactly how much they can gain by doing so. This paper describes a study that measured the benefits of using an e-marketplace to support the procurement process of a construction company. The study included three marketplaces currently operating in Chile. However, in this paper, we focus on Iconstruye, the most important one. 70 executives and professionals from 25 construction companies randomly selected from the 89 that used this marketplace, were interviewed and asked to fill out a questionnaire. This data was validated using data from Iconstruye and from 33 suppliers. The results show that the adoption of an e-marketplace reduces turnaround time, errors, urgent orders, and irregular purchases. A more reliable procurement process directly contributes to a leaner construction process by reducing upstream variability, procurement cycle times, and the need for large inventories on site. Users also perceive an improvement in certain global indicators when using an e-marketplace. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - Pipe spool fabrication is an important stage in industrial construction project delivery. It is a complex production system characterized by product uniqueness and high product mix, which pose challenges to the analysis and improvement of this system. This research applies lean production principles and flow production to shop fabrication, and uses a simulation-based approach as a tool to facilitate its implementation. The work described in the paper is based on a real case study undertaken with an Edmonton-based industrial construction contractor. The traditional batch-and-queue fabrication system and the new cell-based work flow fabrication systems were compared and analyzed. Simulation models were built to experiment with the old and new production systems and quantitatively test the effects of lean principles on the performance of the systems. The developed simulation-based approach proves a practical and more powerful tool than the value stream map for modeling and for quantitatively evaluating the performance of a complex and dynamic spool fabrication shop. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - Given the dynamic nature of construction sites, analysis of construction activities and their related hazards is inadequate for reliable risk assessment if it does not explicitly account for the likelihood of exposure of potential victims to hazardous situations. In traditional risk level calculations for manufacturing industries, the number of victims is factored with the likelihood of an accident and the potential severity, but the victims are simply assumed to be those typically present at the accident location. In construction, exposure cannot be accounted for at a generic metaproject level: it must be assessed at the level of the activities and the physical context in which they are performed. Conceptually, accidents are "loss-of-control events" to which victims are exposed; without exposure, no accident is assumed to occur. A set of algorithms has been developed to demonstrate estimation of the likelihood of exposure of construction workers to loss-of-control events. The algorithms have been implemented in a prototype software application designed to predict fluctuating risk levels in construction projects. The software implements the "construction hazard assessment with spatial and temporal exposure" model for managing safety in construction, which empowers planners at all levels to adjust construction plans to mitigate high levels of risk or to undertake appropriate proactive measures to ensure safety when high risk levels are unavoidable. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - Lean construction has recently attracted considerable attention in the home building industry. Lengthy delivery time and significant waste in the construction process have caused many home builders to seek a more effective production model that will increase process reliability, reduce total lead time, and improve quality. However, although housing construction provides the closest analogy to manufacturing, a high level of variability prevents the direct transplantation of lean paradigm and techniques. In collaboration with a local home builder, a systematic approach based on value stream mapping technique is developed in this research to analyze the current process and to formulate a lean production model. The model has four main features: synchronized first-in, first-out lane-based flow, production leveling at pacemaker, work restructuring, and improved operation reliability. A simulation template is built to verify the model and to assist in the development of interim implementation models. This paper presents data collection and value stream selection, current practice analysis, and specific changes proposed for the lean production model. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - Lean construction research has shown that managing work flow effectively and maintaining labor flow on site can improve construction labor performance. Related research also shows that congestion on construction sites often leads to lowered efficiency. Using these findings as a point of departure, we use the agent-based modeling method to represent the construction site as a system of complex interactions and explore whether labor efficiency can be treated as an emergent property resulting from individual and crew interactions in space. This allows us to use a "bottom-up" approach to analyzing labor efficiency, which supplements existing "top-down" approaches to modeling the impacts of space congestion on labor efficiency. A pilot implementation of the agent-based model, and preliminary results illustrating the relationships between congestion and labor efficiency are presented. The empirical studies exhibit system behavior that support published principles of work-force management. The primary contribution of this paper is that it provides a method that can be used to efficiently utilize construction space, and develop plans and schedules that account for congestion arising from crew interactions in space. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of the paper is to study the influence of procurement on the performance of integrated design teams. Design/methodology/approach – The research paradigm is based on Russian socio-constructivist approach to activity theory. Activity theory, as opposed to natural or social science, is a design science approach that focuses on the context aspect of project. A triangulation of qualitative research methods is used to investigate the dynamic of integrated teams in two different procurement contexts. Findings – The paper is conclusive regarding the influence of procurement on team efficiency. It demonstrates that traditional procurement processes reinforce socio-cognitive barriers that hinder team efficiency. It also illustrates how new procurement modes can transform the dynamic of relationships between the client and the members of the supply chain, and have a positive impact on team performance. Practical implications – The paper demonstrates first that problems with integrated design team efficiency are related to context and not process – they are not technical but socio-cognitive; second that fragmented transactional contracting increases socio-cognitive barriers that hinder integrated design team performance; third that new forms of relational contracting may help to mitigate socio-cognitive barriers and improve integrated design team performance, fourth that changing the context through procurement does not address the problem of obsolete design practices. Originality/value – The paper brings together theories of production in lean construction and social learning as a rival approach to traditional project management theory for demonstrating the importance of context on team performance. © 2009, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - There is a need to develop new information and communication technology (ICT) systems with better support of the contractor's working practice in order to gain more advantages from the virtual models created during the design of buildings. For this reason, a Contextual Design of a prototype (an early example) of an ICT system was carried out to identify and formalise user needs in relation to construction management based on virtual models and radio frequency identification (RFID). The prototype was developed to support working processes in real-time project progress management, quality assurance and inventory management. In this paper a number of user needs for future ICT systems are presented. The needs are captured during the prototype development process and include that future ICT systems must be more user-friendly, enable objectoriented quality assurance procedures, capture data to be used in process optimisation (lean construction), support a wide range of user environments ranging from mobile phones to large displays for presentation and editing data shared in virtual model resources, enable real-time tracking and location of machines and materials, and integrate traditional document/drawing based working practice with the use of virtual models to enable an easier adaptable change process for the construction industry. © 2009 The authors.

AB  - Empirical research was performed into the hypothesis that a substantial number of building performance engineering tasks on design-bid-build projects are typically provided by entities associated with the construction phase, not with the architect-engineer (AE) of record. This hypothesis is contrary to the traditional understanding of design-bid-build and is theorized to result from increased time pressures on AEs, decreased AE profit margins, AEs' attempts to minimize liability, increased design and construction specialization, and increased prefabrication. Project technical specifications were analyzed for 20 $5-45M building construction projects and 16 individuals directly associated with these projects were interviewed. It was found that 35 building performance engineering tasks were required by the project specifications to be performed by entities associated with the construction of the buildings. This large number of delegated design tasks suggests the conventional understanding of the design-bid-build process is not accurate. The increasing fragmentation of the design and construction process may have implications for the efficiency of communication on design-bid-build projects, lean construction processes, and constructability. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - The establishment of Scottish Construction Centre (SCC) aims to highlight the need for improvement of the industry's performance for a more connected and innovative construction industry and for the recognition of the industry's contribution to the Scottish economy. SCC aims to increase awareness of best practice, stimulate industry to innovate, and promote and encourage suitable training. The objective of SCC five-year program is to have a measurable and positive impact, focus on issues it can affect, and facilitate continuous improvement. The ERDF funding to the University of Dundee for research and knowledge transfer allows SCC to extend its existing core programs and diversify them with workshops on Lean Construction and Whole Life Costing. The SCC has collaborated with Fife Construction Forum in the organization and deliver various consultation events across Scotland in January 2009.

AB  - Most of the well-known management and improvement systems and techniques, such as Lean Production (e.g. Just-In-Time (JIT) pull production, one piece flow) and Six Sigma (reduction in variation) were developed in high volume industries. In order to measure the progress of the implementation of such systems, companies and consultants use reference frameworks, which contain descriptions of best practice processes. The core principles of these systems are applicable in any type of industry or service (e.g. focus on reliability and minimisation of waste). However, the best practice references and other implementation tools are dependent on the context in which the principles are applied. For the Engineer-to-Order (ETO) industry, many of the traditional practices (e.g. JIT logistics or line balancing) are not applicable. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI), a best practice reference framework widely used in the software industry, contains practices which are also widely applicable in ETO companies, but that the original model needs to be enhanced. CMMI provides a philosophy, as well as a set of hands-on guidelines and measurable stages for process improvement. CMMI may provide practical techniques to ETO companies which other companies acquire from systems such as Lean Production and Six Sigma. Copyright © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the outcome of an engineering study as part of the design and development of a lean and agile construction system and in particular its supply chain component. This combines modular assembly with a postponement function to be tested on a case study project (not reported here), the objective of which is to improve health, safety, and productivity for the company sponsoring the research. The contribution to research is the combination of countermeasures described in this paper that have been developed and incorporated into a wider construction system, in the same way that manufacturing has used this strategy with great success. A further output is the development and use of an innovative method for assembling, transporting, and installing mechanical and electrical modules, whereby modularization can be achieved with or without offsite manufacturing capability. The research forecasts a reduction of onsite labor of 35% compared to using traditional methods of construction, with less onsite operatives at risk of injury carrying out simpler assembly tasks within ergonomic mobile work cells. Further research is proposed to measure the benefits of the construction system following its implementation on a case study project. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - Purpose – Better integration of project processes has often been identified as the key issue regarding construction performance improvement. In some countries lean construction has become well-established, although there appears to be considerable diversity in the interpretation of the concept. Lean construction initially focused on production aspects, but gradually design issues have started to receive more attention and integrating construction design and production processes from a lean perspective are beginning to be addressed. The purpose of this paper is to identify some of the practical challenges underlying the implementation of approaches promoted as “lean” and compare this with published research/theory. Design/methodology/approach – Following an extensive review of the literature, a multiple case-strategy approach was used to explore the practical application of lean approaches to design and construction integration in an organisational setting. Summaries of the case studies, one from the USA and two from Denmark, help to highlight a number of pertinent issues facing practitioners and researchers. Findings – Findings suggest that it is possible to identify a number of aspects that (in theory as well as in practice) both influence and, to various extents, limit the applicability of the lean philosophy to construction. Findings also help to emphasise the importance of a number of interdependent factors for achieving better integration, namely: value identification/specification; an appropriate project delivery framework; structuring and planning of delivery processes; transparency; management and leadership; learning; and the importance of local context. Originality/value – The findings provide an original contribution to the integration of design and construction activities from a lean perspective. The findings are generic and could be practically applied in a variety of contexts. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - The views of Dr Mick Lynn, Tim Franklin, and John Coleman on the implementation of lean and sustainable processes in the construction sector are discussed. Lean and Sustainability can provide superior productivity, better quality, selective cost reduction, slicker supply chains, and better margins. The most well known application of Lean is by Toyota and that is the reason for which it is referred as the Toyota Production System (TPS). Eastbourne Homes Ltd, an Arms Length Management Organization, has recently undertaken its first steps in Lean. Initial results show that waiting times for disabled adaptations have been reduced by 53% and the backlog of requests for adaptations has been cut from 120 to 46. The suppliers, clients, and other stakeholders are also more deeply involved as an integral part of the process and success.

AB  - Variability in production is one of the largest factors that negatively impacts construction project performance. A common construction practice to protect production systems from variability is the use of buffers (Bf). Construction practitioners and researchers have proposed buffering approaches for different production situations, but these approaches have faced practical limitations in their application. A multiobjective analytic model (MAM) is proposed to develop a graphical solution for the design of Work-In-Process (WIP) Bf in order to overcome these practical limitations to Bf application, being demonstrated through the scheduling of repetitive building projects. Multiobjective analytic modeling is based on Simulation-Optimization (SO) modeling and Pareto Fronts concepts. Simulation-Optimization framework uses Evolutionary Strategies (ES) as the optimization search approach, which allows for the design of optimum WIP Bf sizes by optimizing different project objectives (e.g., project cost, time and productivity). The framework is tested and validated on two repetitive building projects. The SO framework is then generalized through Pareto Front concepts, allowing for the development of the MAM as nomographs for practical use. The application advantages of the MAM are shown through a project scheduling example. Results demonstrate project performance improvements and a more efficient and practical design of WIP Bf. Additionally, production strategies based on WIP Bf and lean production principles in construction are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to better define the relationships between product variety and lean production in enabling mass customization in industrialized homebuilding. Design/methodology/approach – This study includes a case study analysis of two housing plants that instituted lean production systems. For each company, the case study documented the company's background, the product choice offered, the lean implementation approach used, the results obtained, and the effect of product choice on the lean implementation. Using these case study findings, common trends were identified and used to develop guidelines for an effective mass customization strategy for industrialized homebuilders. This paper summarizes the extensive findings for one of the two plants and provides the recommended guidelines developed from common trends identified at both plants. Findings – Case study findings indicated that product choice does not necessarily make the implementation of lean concepts more difficult. In fact, good lean concepts (e.g. continuous flow, pull system, workload leveling, defect-free processes, standard tasks, good visual control, and reliable technology) were also good concepts for (or easily accommodated) handling a range of product choice. Research limitations/implications – Research findings are limited by the small number of plants involved in the study. Originality/value – The paper makes an important contribution to the understanding of both lean production and mass customization, identifying the lean principles that facilitate mass customization for industrialized homebuilders. Findings also provide useful guidelines for builders interested in better addressing specific customer needs, while managing the operational complexities resulting from product variety. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - The applicability of lean principles and practices to industrialized housing in Sweden are examined, taking the production culture into consideration. The factory production of industrialized housing shows apparent similarities to manufacturing, but areas related to fully integrated lean production practices, such as error proofing and standardized work floor and equipment maintenance, are scarce. Hence, applicability of lean principles and practices to industrialized housing production is clearly influenced by a production culture that has similarities to a traditional construction culture. Setting up industrialized housing production thus requires careful implementation of lean principles if workers from traditional building are moved into factories, and managers still adhere to the prevailing site-based production mentality. However, the influence of the traditional construction project culture is not solely a constraint; flexible teams that take their own responsibility are also important in a lean culture. Hence, retaining parts of the existing construction mentality, context and way of working is also central when discussing lean applicability in industrialized housing.

AB  - Lean production is a systemic approach to meeting customer expectations, whatever they value, by reducing waste. At first glance, lean then could only contribute to sustainability, while sustainability is achieved only if the customer values sustainability. The paper has two objectives. One is to examine whether sustainability is feasible using lean production with sustainability as an added value. The second objective is to examine how current lean construction tools and methods impact the construction and operation of sustainable facilities. The authors also suggest how these lean construction tools and methods have evolved to contribute to green construction. For this study, the authors interviewed lean adopters and conducted literature surveys on lean principles and methods, and its impacts on the economic, social and environmental sustainability.

AB  - With the launch of the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) rating system, new building construction in the United States has rapidly begun adopting this guide as the standard for sustainable building. The rating system profoundly alters the design and operation of buildings, however, to date, little has been documented on the cumulative effects of the rating system across different phases of the project lifecycle: planning, architecture/design, engineering, construction and operational facility management (AEC+P+F). Further, the ability to gain efficiencies in the building phase itself is still unknown. Implications of the delivery system in LEED® attainment also have not been clearly associated with the level of AEC+P+F integration. To pursue this goal, project participants are becoming involved earlier in the process; information exchanges take place throughout the project lifecycle; and the results of those frequent exchanges impact the value to the owner through focus on attainment of a particular green rating score. These features are configuring a framework for green project delivery. This framework approaches lean thinking by generating value to the owner, improving the flow of information, and transforming the inputs required for the selection of materials and systems, to outputs in the form of a sustainability rating certification. This research focuses on exploring associations between LEED® criteria, project lifecycle, the stakeholders' interests, lean process improvements and typical delivery systems used in building construction. The paper proposes a matrix of weighted indexes to explain and provide increased collaboration among project participants, improved efficiency throughout the project lifecycle, and new techniques which may be incorporated into the construction process.

AB  - Learning from manufacturing industries is a useful approach to improving the productivity of the construction industry and to solve problems arising from construction processes. Through the use of virtual prototyping (VP) technology, the lean production process engaged in the IKEA business model (IKEA model) is studied and implemented in a real-life construction project. Specifically, based on the analysis of the IKEA model, the IKEA model can be applied to optimize construction processes and simplify management activities. A case study is analysed to demonstrate the improvement of construction process management through using the VP-IKEA approach.

AB  - The objective of this ongoing joint research program is to determine how 3D/4D modeling, simulation and visualization of Products (buildings), Organizations and Processes (POP) can support lean construction. Initial findings suggest that Process Design Pattern may have the potential to intuitively support ICT based lean construction. We initiated a "Process Archeology" in order to reveal the requirements for tools that can support the planning, simulation and control of lean construction methods. First findings show that existing tools provide only limited support and therefore, we started to develop new methodologies and technologies to overcome these shortcomings. Through the introduction of Process Design Patterns, we intent to establish process thinking in the interdisciplinary POP design. Optimized construction processes may be synthesized with semi-automatic methods by applying Process Design Patterns on building structures. By providing process templates that integrate problem solution and expert knowledge, Process Design Patterns may have the potential to ensure high quality process models. © 2008 Tsinghua University Press.

AB  - Although the concepts of cognitive systems engineering (CSE) are usually applied in high-risk and highly automated complex systems, its insights might also be beneficial to the construction industry. This paper emphasizes how five safety management practices - process transparency, safety planning, proactive performance measurement, accident investigations, and identification and monitoring of pressures and performance migrations - can be improved and re-interpreted based on three CSE principles (flexibility, learning and awareness). Those practices were chosen due to their importance in construction safety and also for the availability of empirical data from six construction sites in which the authors have implemented a safety planning and control (SPC) model. Moreover, autonomation, a lean production concept that was not encompassed by the SPC model, was included in the discussion because of its potential role as an enabler of the application of the CSE principles discussed in this paper. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is contended that competitiveness is better understood as a discourse rather than as a characteristic that is supposedly possessed. The discourse of competitiveness derives its legitimacy from the enterprise culture that came to dominance during the 1980s. Current popularized theories of competitiveness are constituent parts of this broader discourse, which has had significant material implications for the UK construction sector. The dominant discourse of competitiveness amongst contracting firms is shaped by the need to achieve structural flexibility to cope with fluctuations in demand. Fashionable espoused improvement recipes such as total quality management, business process re-engineering, and lean construction legitimize and reinforce the material manifestations of the enterprise culture. In consequence, the UK industry is characterized by a plethora of hollowed-out firms that have failed to invest in their human capital. While the adopted model may be rational for individual firms, the systemic effect across the sector as a whole equates to a form of anorexia. However, the discourse of competitiveness is by no means monolithic and continues to be contested locally. There have also been numerous counter-discourses that have been mobilized in response to the undesirable externalities of unbridled enterprise. Currently, important counter-discourses promote the ideas of sustainability and corporate social responsibility.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the transfer of lean manufacturing/production from the Japanese manufacturing industry to the construction sector in the west. Design/methodology/approach - Research literature from the fields of lean manufacturing/production and lean construction was reviewed. This revealed a number of characteristics that are specific to lean construction, most notably the recognition that critical research findings have been slow to emerge but appear to be gaining momentum. Findings - In the transition from manufacturing to construction the process losses appear to be related to critical aspects and the challenges surrounding practical application to a different context. Lean is highly interpretive and there is no shared definition or understanding of what is meant by lean, lean production, and lean construction. The focus has been mainly on production system design, planning and management, and implementation. This narrow focus has meant that some important issues concerning the wider aspects of lean have been overlooked. There is a need for a "back to basics" discussion on many other aspects of the approach, such as whole-life value and waste identification. Research limitations/implications - The work is limited to an extensive literature review. Originality/value - The extensive literature review makes an original contribution to the lean construction field and provides a valuable resource for researchers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Variability is a well-known problem in construction projects, which leads to the general deterioration of project performance. During the last decade, the Last Planner System (LPS), a production planning and control system based on lean production principles, has been increasingly applied in the construction industry to improve planning reliability reducing the negative impacts of variability. LPS promotes actions to increase planning reliability, monitoring the percentage of plan completed (PPC) in a short-term period. However, there is limited research evidence about the relationship between planning reliability and project performance. In this paper, the authors report on a detailed research analysing this relationship during the construction phase of a home building project at activity and project levels. By doing so, two indexes are proposed: an activity planning reliability index called the process reliability index (PRI), and a project aggregate labour productivity index, called the project productivity index (PPI). Statistical analyses using the proposed indexes were conducted showing positive and strong relationships between planning reliability and performance at activity and project levels. Finally, the research findings provide the guidelines of a preliminary methodology to forecast the impacts of planning reliability over project performance, when lean production methodologies are applied in project planning and control.

AB  - A construction process reengineering framework and its corresponding methodologies have been developed by integrating lean principles and computer simulation techniques. Instead of classifying activities into value-adding and non-value-adding activities, or into conversion and flow activities as is common in lean production practices, this framework classifies activities into main and supportive activities and/or into normal and interactive activities. This classification makes it more effective in modeling the construction workflow and reengineering the construction process. It also avoids the confusion of the classification of activities into value-adding and non-value-adding activities encountered in the construction industry. In addition, computer simulation techniques are incorporated into the framework to virtually simulate and assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the reengineered construction process that is achieved based on lean principles. Simulation makes it easier to quantify and assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the reengineered construction process. © 2008 ASCE.

AB  - The installation of water and sewer services is an essential element of many construction projects. With an increasing number of construction projects being undertaken, in metropolitan areas, delays are no longer affordable. To increase productivity in this type of construction project, workflow must be improved. This paper describes the application of lean thinking principles to improve the productivity of water and sewer service installations. To illustrate this, a case study is presented that applies these principles to water and sewer service installations performed by City of Edmonton construction crews. As well, this paper outlines a study that applies the lean thinking procedures recommended within a queuing theory model to validate the effect of the proposed improvements to productivity. Potential improvements to overall productivity will be discussed along with proposed future research. © 2008 NRC Canada.

AB  - Purpose - There is a view that firms should decide between a lean or agile approach to supply management primarily on the basis of whether their product offering is "functional" (predictable demand, low variety and a long life cycle) or "innovative" (unpredictable demand, high variety and a short life cycle). This paper aims to present and test the proposition that this dichotomy is less useful in complex, one-off project environments, such as shipbuilding or construction, because projects typically require the assembly of many different, largely functional, products in a unique or innovative configuration. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports a case study focusing on one of the supply chains serving a major UK shipyard. The case study data were gathered by means of semi-structured face-to-face interviews with key personnel (procurement, sales, production, materials management and engineering/design) from each company within the defined supply chain. Findings - The case study reveals that the design and build process used in the shipyard introduces radical unpredictability into the demand for "functional" components of naval vessels. Originality/value - The paper raises important questions as to the conceptual robustness and the empirical generalisability of some of the extant literature on supply strategy selection. In particular, the case study suggests that a core assumption - that the demand for functional products is relatively predictable - is not sustainable in the context of project specific supply chains where the ultimate demand is generated by an active organisational buyer.

AB  - Many researchers and project managers have attempted to improve project performance by applying new philosophies such as lean principle, just-in-time, pull scheduling, and last planner. However, very little research has been conducted on setting definite quantitative goals for performance improvement while considering the defect rate involved in the construction operations. This research explores practical solutions for construction performance improvement by applying the six sigma principle. This principle provides the metrics required to establish performance improvement goals and a methodology for measuring and evaluating improvement. The proposed approach is expected to achieve more reliable workflows by reducing process variability to fit in a desirable range-thereby improving the overall performance through the evaluation of the quality level in current construction operations. To verify the suggested methodology, two case studies have been presented and process simulation analyses are performed to observe the performance changes based on the six sigma principle. Critical total quality control, as the sigma level rises, is also discussed. © 2008 ASCE.

AB  - Among the alternatives to assure its survival, a particularly relevant one for Organizations is innovation. Innovation has several dimensions among which it is possible to include: i) raw material; ii) product; iii) process; iv) market; v) the way how administration is made. This paper has the objective to show the possibility to implement a new management way in the industries of mineral extraction through the integrated use of the concepts developed in the construction of the Toyota of Production System (TPS)/Lean Production System, and the concepts and traditional techniques originating from the Mining Engineering and the Industrial Engineering. The paper shows this integration in two sceneries of the mining (fluospar and amethyst). The results indicate the reduction of the production costs and increase of the productivity and the improvement of the Workers Life Quality.

AB  - New approaches to production management can be conceptualized as treating production as flow rather than transformation. These alternatives can in turn be regarded as reflecting opposing ontological positions, holding respectively that reality is constituted of temporal process, or atemporal substance. The new production philosophy thus arguably represents a process ontology radically different from the atemporal metaphysics underlying conventional methods and theories. Moreover, research in physics education has identified the disjunction between ontological categories of 'substance' and 'process' as a particularly acute barrier to understanding process phenomena. Studies are presented which demonstrate the possibility of specifying and classifying mental models, with regard to two important management solutions in construction. Thus, procedures typically adopted in quantity surveying and the implementation of structural engineering design are examined. Methods of measurement used in quantity surveying are designed to account primarily for physical, rather than temporal properties. In design, the emphasis is on representing properties of finished structures, rather than the construction processes. The process is then managed by treating the design and its execution as separate products. It is argued here that alternative, more effective management solutions are derived from a process ontology.

AB  - Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) has become something of a magic wand for large manufacturing industries because of its capability to integrate different manufacturing modules via online networks and hence providing one window access thereby making the whole manufacturing process integrated with a reduction in inventory. Ship production is not a manufacturing process in a strict sense because of high customisation, widely varying scales of operations and less compatibility between various production processes. Ship production is planned in an activity driven network scheduling system ingeneral and is assumed more as a construction process or assembling process rather than a manufacturing process. An ERP principle is based upon information management and process integration and hence is effective in all manufacturing processes that need to integrate the processes for streamlined, lean and synergised manufacturing, A modular approach to design has been regarded as the new logic for product design and its organisation, as it helps design and manufacturing firms to cope with the present volatile and turbulent environment. This combines the ERP principle and modular approach to design. The ERP principle is used to design the manufacturing management system for the modularly designed ships. In this series of two papers, we discuss development of an ERP model for a medium scale shipyard. Part I, discusses a methodology for manufacturing management: planning and integration of ship manufacturing processes for the modularly designed ships in a medium size shipyard. The manufacturing management is integration driven and is based upon activity based network scheduling. In this work, it is shown that by combining network scheduling, ERP and modular approach to design, the ship manufacturing process will be more streamlined, better planned and executed.

AB  - A lean model has been proposed for the construction management of high-rise apartment buildings with customized apartment designs. It incorporates a number of changes to traditional management practice, including single-piece flow with pull scheduling, work restructuring, and multiskilling. A simulated construction process scenario was devised for experimental evaluation of the model. The simulation was first implemented as a live management game, in which participants played the roles of the clients, general contractor, and subcontractors. Eleven runs with different teams indicated that the lean model increased throughput, improved cash flow, and reduced apartment delivery cycle time. However, the limitations of the live simulation led the writers to implement a discrete event computer simulation of the same process. The computer simulation reinforced the findings of the live simulation and emphasized the specific beneficial effect of single-piece flow under pull scheduling. The lean model may be of immediate interest to construction planners and managers because it enables full customization with minimal waste and no additional resources. The demonstrative clarity of the lean model simulation, both live and computerized, makes it a powerful tool for education and research. © 2007 ASCE.

AB  - Comprehending activity status is essential to successful project management. When construction workers report activity information, project managers understand activity progresses. This procedure forms information exchange and flow. However, the lack of up-to-date information still causes project problems (such as increasing unnecessary costs, making erroneous decisions and improper activity scheduling), and highlights the importance of on-site data collection. For improving this condition, this study integrates two managerial philosophies ("theory of constraints (TOC)" and lean construction) to propose a synchronization-based model. When this model was applied for a material management case study, asynchronous operations accompanied with unnecessary subprocesses were recognized as an influence on on-site information production and transmission. This study then applied synchronous operations based on worker cooperation to resolve these problems, and evaluated the efficiency obtained by the identified measurements. The proposed model offers not only a prototype of synchronous on-site data collection, but also a mechanism for activity performance improvement. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In many of the industrialized lean construction efforts in the construction industry today, collaborative communication and its supporting ICT have been reduced to a secondary issue in favour of rationalizing the physical design and production processes, as if effective project communication practices and technologies are taken for granted. Often when ICT based communication is discussed and managed in construction it often only comprises the technical aspects of information handling, such as modelling, classification and standardization. This paper introduces the subject field of Project Communication, which considers the improvement of organization, group processes, work procedures, as well as the sharing and transfer of knowledge between different professional domains in projects and corporations. The subject area has a special focus on the concept of the integration of project organizations and the creation of an effective platform for collaboration through shared ICT business tools. One prioritized field of research in this area is the problematic issue of creating true usefulness, user acceptance and organizational adoption of ICT in project team work. The paper describes four indicative feasibility studies in Project Communication in the Swedish construction sector. It argues that to solve the practical problems that the industry is encountering, as described in the studies, the perspective must be widened so as to include information and communication technology from an organizational and management viewpoint.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to suggest the application of the line-of-balance (LoB) scheduling technique in combination with a 4D CAD workspace model as a method to improve the management of the flow of resources through locations in construction projects, defined as work flow. Current scheduling methods fail to consistently manage work flow, which can disrupt the construction process, leading to waste such as conflicts in time and space by construction crews. Design/methodology/approach – LoB and 4D CAD are applied to a case study of multi-story timber housing project involving the construction of 95 apartments in five six-storey buildings. Based on the case study results, the benefits and limitations of the combined use of both methods are discussed. Findings – The majority of the problems experienced during the actual construction process quickly become evident from an analysis of a relatively simple LoB diagram. Furthermore, the 4D CAD workspace model provides additional insights in the scheduling of construction activities, such as workspace availability, the spatial context of workspaces and partial overlap of workspaces. Practical implications – Virtual design and construction methods based on principles from lean construction can contribute significantly to the value of the product and the elimination of waste in any construction project. Originality/value – The paper refers to the guiding principles from lean construction in relation to virtual design and construction methods, such as simulations with 4D CAD. Additional research and studies of practical applications are suggested to facilitate the combination of principles from lean construction with virtual design and construction methods. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Execution of the finishing works in high-rise apartment buildings is made complex by the need to customize apartments to the varying requirements and designs of individual clients. The conventional construction planning practice of progressing upward from floor to floor breaks down in the face of the arbitrary sequence in which clients finalize their decisions. The results are long cycle times for delivery of completed apartments and corollary high levels of work in progress, budget and schedule overruns, and general dissatisfaction with the process on the part of the developer, contractor, subcontractors, and the clients. Application of lean construction principles to this problem has led to development of a management model that adopts pull scheduling, reduced batch sizes, and a degree of multiskilling. The main benefits expected are an enhanced ability to provide customized apartments, improved cash flow, and reduced apartment delivery cycle times. The model was first formulated in theory, then tested using a management simulation game and computer simulation, and subsequently, developed for practical application. This paper presents an analysis of conventional practice, the theoretical background to the lean approach, and the specific management changes proposed. © ASCE.

AB  - Subcontracting has greatly increased in the construction industry. It helps shift risk from the main contractor to the subcontractor and promotes specialization. Inadequate subcontracting management, however, may result in an adversarial relationship between main contractors and their subcontractors, uncoordinated on-site execution, and disappointing quality and schedule fulfillment. New subcontractor management methods and tools are being developed and tested as part of a collaborative research project led by the Catholic University Production Management Center with the participation of the Chilean Construction Chamber and several construction companies. The experience gained by testing prototype tools and methods on selected projects enabled us to develop an on-site evaluation method based on lean principles and partnering practices. This method allows main contractors to help subcontractors improve their performance by providing them with periodic feedback. It also supports subcontractor selection based on their previous performance, which helps foster collaborative relationships with those that consistently perform well. The results of the application of the method in two case studies are discussed. © 2007 ASCE.

AB  - The production equation called Little's law has been applied to construction data recently. However, Little's law was derived for steady-state conditions assuming constant input and output rates and long production runs. Production in construction is inherently temporary, and learning curves and environmental influences often render input and output rates unequal and nonlinear. Starting with a conservation of mass formulation, general equations for work-in-process and cycle time for unsteady-state conditions and limited run production are developed. The motivation behind these equations is to explain common trends in production variables seen on construction projects. Previous studies have shown that when output from a construction production system is drastically increased, a significant upward impact is also seen on cycle time and work-in-process, and this work provides underlying theory and equations to explain these trends. Cycle time and work-in-process equations are presented as functions of time and on average. Data from construction activities are used to show that unsteady-state conditions commonly occur. Reasonable simplifications of the general equations provide guidelines for buffer sizing and resource allocation decisions. © 2007 ASCE.

AB  - New management thinking, like that of lean construction, has suggested many principles and techniques that can result in better labor and cost performance. This paper focuses on improving construction labor productivity in Egypt by applying two lean construction principles, namely benchmarking and reducing variability in labor productivity. Using labor productivity data from masonry activities on eleven building projects in Egypt, several measures of benchmarks of construction labor productivity are demonstrated, calculated, and then used to evaluate the productivity of bricklayers and identify the best and worst performing projects. The benchmarks include disruption index (DI), performance ratio (PR), and project management index (PMI). On the other hand reducing variability of labor productivity is another important lean construction principle. The labor productivity variability of the studied projects is calculated using the coefficient of productivity variation. The correlation between variability in labor productivity and project performance was also examined statistically. From the application of the two lean construction principles, it was concluded that the benchmarks of labor productivity (DI, PR, and PMI) were found to be reliable indicators of project labor performance. In addition, the variability in daily labor productivity was found to be an important delineator between good and poorly performing projects. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.

AB  - Purpose – This paper seeks to test the applicability of lean principles to simple construction processes using discrete-event simulation. Design/methodology/approach – Quantitative construction data and process mapping of plastering and block-laying processes were first gathered and established from construction project through field observation and interviews with those involved in the selected projects. Then a simulation model was built to mimic the aforementioned processes to study the impact of certain lean principles. The simulation models became like an experimentation tool where lean principles (e.g. focus on actual objects and map the value stream) were introduced to evaluate their impact on such processes. Findings – Lean principles are effective not only in complicated processes, as proved in previous studies, but also in simple processes. Enhancing the flow of construction materials means the less time they will spend in the value stream and as a result the leaner a process will be. In fact, simple processes are good candidate for lean improvements. Research limitations/implications – Simulating lean principles did not bring different construction processes to the leanest level of performance. There are other factors that govern each process. Rework, uncertainty, labor skills, site conditions and location are some examples of such factors that need further analyses for leaner construction processes. Originality/value – Many studies focused on complicated processes to investigate the applicability of lean principles to construction. Results of these studies affirmed the great potentiality of such principles in improving construction processes. This study readdressed the issue of lean applicability to construction by focusing on simple processes, which are block-laying and plastering. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Lean construction is about reducing waste in a given construction project. A building construction in a lean regime is designed specifically with operations in mind, therefore, research and collaboration is an essential part of the design process. Lean construction leads to reduced costs associated with waste raw material, hence, the structure's carbon footprint, reducing wasted embedded energy as well as CO2 emissions. In order to implement a lean construction strategy, end user, architect, building contractor and key suppliers must join forces to form a design collaboration. After pinpointing exact requirements with all parties at an early stage, the opportunity for design errors occuring during the build process is minimized. This facilitates a fast, uninterrupted work-flow and also should help eliminate over/under-ordering raw materials.

AB  - The demand for high performance ''green'' or ''sustainable'' buildings is rapidly becoming the most significant trend in the building industry. As the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry develops the strategies and technologies for these projects, an increased emphasis must be placed on the processes and competencies required to deliver high performance buildings. This paper defines an emerging research and education program at Penn State called the Lean and Green Initiative. Focused on understanding all aspects of the delivery of high performance projects, this program is underpinned by established process-based theories and structured around a systematic methodology designed to minimize waste, maximize value, and reduce cost. Current research and educational activities are described in the paper including nine primary research thrusts and their respective goals. Initial results of each research thrust are also provided, providing an early look at the benefits of a process improvement approach to the delivery of high performance buildings.

AB  - Rapid growth of residential construction in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada has led to an increased demand for lot grading (LG) inspectors. The traditional inspection process has contributed to inspection delays, backlog, and decreased customer satisfaction. The aim of the research presented in this paper is to study, evaluate, and optimize the existing LG approval process. Data from past years were collected and analyzed to establish a baseline performance level. Flowcharts were developed to visualize the process and a survey was conducted to determine potential areas of improvement from the perspectives of different shareholders. Lean thinking principles were applied to identify and reduce the nonvalue added activities and improve performance. The final phase of the research involved the simulation of the process to evaluate the impact of the implementation of various recommendations. Based on the simulation results, final recommendations were made and later implemented with the help from the city's Information technology department. These modifications to the existing process produced significant gains in quality and productivity, as predicted by the simulation model. © 2006 ASCE.

AB  - Many contractors prefer on-site fabrication of rebar while others find that off-site fabrication is more advantageous. The economics of on-site and off-site fabrication of rebar need to be compared on the basis of several factors that include the project environment, wages, labour considerations, the initial investment for equipment, waste of rebar, the cost of inventory, cycle time, and supply chain management. This study presents an economic comparison of the on-site and off-site fabrication practices of rebar by means of a simulation model that makes use of the factors mentioned earlier. The model is populated with actual data obtained from a trade centre project in Istanbul, Turkey. The article indicates that the off-site fabrication practice would have been more costly than the on-site practice in the project in Istanbul, a finding that was to be expected in circumstances that prevail in most developing countries.

AB  - This article compares the techniques developed for lean construction with those developed for lean manufacturing. Lean manufacturing and lean construction techniques share many common elements despite the obvious differences in their assembly environments and processes. Manufacturing plants and construction sites are different in many ways that might explain why lean production theories and practices do not fully fit the construction industry. Though many lean construction tools and elements are still in an embryonic state, lean construction techniques are gaining popularity because they can affect the bottom line of projects. Additionally, this paper presents a study of a construction project in which specific lean construction elements were tested. Each technique was evaluated in terms of its impact on the performance of the project. Based on the findings of the study, a new "lean assessment tool" is proposed to quantify the results of lean implementations. The assessment tool evaluates six lean construction elements: last planner, increased visualization, huddle meetings, first-run studies, five S's, and fail safe for quality. This paper provides a simple and comprehensive approach that is transferable to any construction project. © ASCE.

AB  - Facility owners and project teams often struggle to engage "green" or "sustainable" requirements on building projects and can incur additional project costs as a result. Although "investments" in high performance building features can be paid back through operational savings, the project delivery methods currently adopted by most teams are laden with process waste. Lean production principles have been proven to reduce waste and improve process performance in highly complex development and production environments. Adopting these lean principles, this paper reports a study that identified the presence of value and waste in a sustainable building project. Through an empirical investigation of the Real Estate and Facilities Division of Toyota Motor Sales, Toyota's capital facility delivery process was mapped to identify both the steps in project delivery critical for success (value) and those that are waste. The investigation focused on the South Campus Facility, which received U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold certification at a project cost equivalent to a conventional facility. Through post hoc process-based analysis, insight about what added value and waste in sustainable project delivery at Toyota was obtained. The results also identify further improvement opportunities to Toyota's delivery process. For corporate facility owners and the Architecture Engineering Construction industry, the results unearth insights about how to successfully and economically deliver sustainable facilities. © ASCE.

AB  - Periodic review and adjustment of resource allocations to construction projects is critical for subcontractors to maintain profitability under traditional unit price or lump sum contracts. Project managers strive to control subcontractors in an effort to meet budgets and schedules; subcontractors often work on multiple projects simultaneously and strive independently to allocate resources to those projects where they perceive that they will bring maximum utility. An economic game theory model is proposed as a foundation for understanding the behaviour of subcontractors in allocating resources to projects. The model describes the influence of the degree of reliability of the planned schedule on subcontractors' and project managers' behaviours under traditional unit price contracting. Unreliable plans undermine efforts to promote cooperative behaviour.

AB  - Purpose To illustrate the potential danger of applying “lean thinking” discretely and indiscriminantly in a project environment with high levels of complexity and uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach Insights are presented from two case studies of private residential construction projects which the authors believe are indicative of recent efforts to reduce the cost of construction activities. Findings Evidence was found of attempts to remove capacity in transportation, stockholding and on-site labour. Some of these attempts were logical and resulted in cost-savings but others were illogical and resulted in reduced levels of responsiveness and flexibility to respond to the uncertainty which is a characteristic of most construction projects. Research limitations/implications Further research is required to quantify the impact of discrete improvements in functional aspects of supply chain projects and the conditions in which lean thinking can be put to best effect. Practical implications Firms operating in the construction sector need to pay greater attention to the impact on the effectiveness of supply chain projects of achieving cost savings in discrete activities. Originality/value This paper challenges conventional thinking with respect to the application of lean principles to the construction industry and calls for greater awareness of the project-centric nature of the construction industry and the application of lean thinking therein. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - This paper presents research results that describe how value generation can be improved in the design process of industrial projects when using computer advanced visualization tools (CAVT). The CAVT concept definition, prior studies about impacts of CAVT, and why they are not sufficient are presented in the paper, supporting the assertion that the extensive attention to technology instead of to the context of technology application and the lack of a conceptual framework has prevented some prior research about CAVT impacts to truly focus in ideas about how to improve engineering and construction processes. Combining production theory and lean construction principles with information technology (IT), a framework for understanding the impacts of CAVT developed as part of the research is proposed. Illustration of the use of the framework in a case study and research validation activities leads to analytic generalization of the research results. © ASCE.

AB  - Accounts of the spread of management ideas emphasizing the role of 'supply-side' actors underplay the active role recipients play in translating them into new and different forms. Comparing firms undergoing a similar process and looking at how a specific event unfolded, this paper aims to extend understanding of the concept of translation. It examines how ideas are rendered appropriate to a new setting through translation from the broad policy level into a set of specific practices. To do this, it looks at how a proposal to introduce lean management into the construction industry was applied within a set of firms and the projects they were undertaking. In the context of large 'distance' between the original arenas of the idea and its new one, the paper uncovers how the editing rules that are said to guide the process of translation are operationalized using a set of change interventions. © 2005 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Reliable construction schedules are important for effective co-ordination across the supply chain and various trades at the construction work face. Reliability of construction schedules can be enhanced and improved through satisfying all potential constraints prior to execution on site. Availability of resources, execution space, execution logic, physical dependency of construction products, client instructions and others can be regarded as potential constraints. Current scheduling tools and techniques are fragmented and designed to deal with a limited set of construction constraints. In this context, a methodology termed 'multi-constraint scheduling' is introduced in which four major groups of construction constraints including physical, contract, resource and information constraints are considered to demonstrate the approach. A genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed and used for a multi-constraint optimization problem. Given multiple constraints such as activity dependency, limited working area, and resource and information readiness, the GA alters tasks' priorities and construction methods so as to arrive at an optimum or near optimum set of project duration, cost, and smooth resource profiles. The multi-constraints approach has been practically developed as an embedded macro in MS Project. Several experiments were conducted using a simple project and it was concluded that GA can provide near optimum and constraint-free schedules within an acceptable searching time. This will be vital to improve the productivity and predictability of construction sites. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Purpose – Increasing global competition, free trade agreements, low cost foreign labor, and customer expectations are causing manufacturing enterprises to implement aggressive transformation plans. Should these transformations be incremental or enterprise-wide? This paper aims to address the question by developing a Lean Enterprise Architecture (LEA) concept for an enterprise-wide transformation. Design/methodology/approach – The LEA is an architectural framework for enterprise reengineering in the design, construction, integration, and implementation of a lean enterprise using systems engineering methods. The architecture uses a multiphase approach structured on the transformation life cycle phases. Findings – Viewing lean implementation across the entire enterprise minimizes the possibility of overlooking opportunities for further performance improvement. A silo view of lean implementation may allow gaps in performance to persist, with no one assuming responsibility for the entire enterprise. Employing the principles of the LEA will help improve enterprise-wide quality, on-time delivery, and customer satisfaction by eliminating waste in the entire organization and supply chain. Research limitations/implications – Applications and benefits are cited in the paper, but additional case studies are needed to benchmark the performance of the LEA against incremental lean implementations. Practical implications – The LEA was created for the US military aerospace industry, but it is now being adopted in other commercial sectors for major transformation designs. Originality/value – The LEA is the first known integration of lean thinking, enterprise architectures, and systems engineering principles in a design framework for the transformation of an enterprise. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Energy sector capital projects typically cost hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars. Managing the engineered equipment is important not only because of their high dollar value but also because the long manufacturing lead times often drive the overall project schedules. In recent years, several supplier alliances have been successfully implemented on such projects leading to initial price savings in the range from 6 to 10%. This paper presents the result of a study to assess the opportunities and barriers with such partnerships. Interviewed company executives perceived that time savings and quality improvements, mostly due to the suppliers' specialized expertise, are of much greater value than a lower bid price. Most surprisingly, very few companies use metrics to measure performance, thus leaving them in the dark on the question of how well an alliance worked or why it failed. The relevance of the presented work is in the amount of actual field data that has been generated and processed. ©ASCE.

AB  - Project delays due to late availabilities of resource and information (RI) prerequisites are one of the major threats to construction management. It is desirable to avoid such delays through better means of constraint management. With most contemporary planning methodologies and tools, it is generally difficult to represent many hidden flow constraints in a construction work plan. However, evaluating the impact of flow constraints is crucial in determining their criticalities, based on which the flow constraints may be prioritized and consequently resolved to minimize project delays. Due to the fact that limited resources are often shared among various trades, it may not be practical to resolve all the constraints simultaneously so that a tradeoff is inevitable, which suggests that management should focus on the most important ones termed as key constraints (i.e., those directly contributing to project delays). This paper presents a methodology that augments the traditional critical path method with RI availability constraints to analyze the causes of delays and locate the key constraints binding on project completion without ambiguity based on the principles of the theory of constraints. The methodology of key constraint analysis has been implemented with the integrated production scheduler, a constraint-based scheduling tool which facilitates the modeling, analysis, and management of constraints at the production planning level. An illustrative example is depicted to demonstrate how the proposed methodology works. © ASCE.

AB  - Buffers of material stockpile (inventory) are formed at the work level in construction to help manage production. The size of material stockpiles often has an important bearing on construction project performance. In construction projects, where conditions are often uncertain and variable, some have suggested that buffers be sized and located according to the conditions. New management thinking like lean construction and theory of constraints suggests that the size of buffers needs to be managed carefully, because when oversized, buffers are wasteful, impede workflow, and hinder performance. Research has shown that project variability can be affected with the careful deployment of buffers but has not really evaluated the impact on construction labor performance. This paper reports an exploratory analysis of the relationship between inventory (buffers) and construction labor performance with data collected from three commercial projects in Brazil. In this study, the size of the buffer between rebar fabrication and installation in the construction of a structural system is compared to the labor performance of the fabrication and installation crews. The results show that some buffer helps achieve the best labor performance in the construction operations studied. © ASCE.

AB  - This paper discusses the consequences competitive bidding have on lead time in project-based production, such as construction. Earlier studies argued that competitive bidding may significantly increase resource consumption and generate waste in the delivery process, which this paper supports. However, the relation between competitive bidding and lead time has been less discussed. Lead time reduction has long been considered a fundamental objective for overall business improvement. An objective of our study was to understand what contributes to long lead times. The reported findings are from a 4-year study on the delivery process of power distribution equipment, a type of engineered-to-order (ETO) product. The paper concludes by suggesting procurement practices that reduce lead times for ETO products. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Modeling and analyzing construction operations using simulation techniques allows researchers to capture the uncertainty and randomness usually associated with these operations and can thus be an effective tool for analysis and improvement. However, the effort and knowledge required to build simulation models and experiment with them tend to limit the use of simulation in construction. A common recommendation for removing this obstacle found in the literature leans towards developing simulation tools that reduce model development and experimentation time on the construction engineer's side by packaging most of the knowledge required into the tool itself. Such "intelligent" simulation modeling tools may significantly impact the way construction engineers use simulation techniques in day-to-day decision making. This paper presents a framework that extends and formalizes this recommendation by providing the foundation for building intelligence into simulation objects. The proposed framework provides the structure necessary for building intelligence and autonomy into simulation objects and permits a further reduction in the knowledge required to experiment with simulation models. This approach also automates model modification, not only through changes in numeric parameters, but through topological model changes as well, which may assist the model user in making many decisions throughout the different phases of simulation experimentation. © ASCE.

AB  - Purpose - Lean construction looks into the possibility of bringing successful lean production theories into the construction industry. It was believed that lean production principles could also be influenced by the essence of military strategies, specifically that of Sun Tzu's Art of War (ST) when these were introduced many years ago. This study looks into the practices of lean construction in the industry and the similarities in the two sets of statements from lean construction principles and Sun Tzu's strategic principles. Design/methodology/approach - Surveys and interviews of 40 project managers in the construction industry were conducted. Findings - The study suggests that there are some agreements between lean construction principles and Sun Tzu's strategic principles. Research limitations/implications - This study raises the interesting question of whether the origin of lean construction principles can be traced to the strategic principles formulated by Sun Tzu some 2,500 years ago. Practical implications - It is recommended that the strategic principles formulated by Sun Tzu be tapped upon for the further extension of lean principles (LP) in construction. Originality/value - The value of this paper lies in its reflections of ST to better understand the possible origin of current lean construction principles and practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - A manufactured home is a factory-built house constructed in a controlled factory environment according to federal standards known as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) code. The manufactured home shares approximately 20% of the total housing units in the United States and plays an important role in providing affordable housing. However, in terms of material engineering, advanced techniques are scarcely used in the manufactured housing (MH) industry. The current material flow and control systems are characterized as independent demand systems that are based on the personal experience of the material managers. Although independent inventory control systems are widely used in many manufacturing industries, these systems lead to a large amount of inventory and have many drawbacks for the MH industry. On the other hand, dependent inventory systems can reduce unfavorable inventory levels using new techniques and present substantial benefits for the MH industry. This paper applies lean inventory control systems and supply chain management techniques to the current systems of the MH industry and proposes a new framework of material control systems as one of the system management tools. ©ASCE.

AB  - Since the early 1990s, the construction industry has taken some interest in the application of lean production to its own case. A new body of research led by the International Group for Lean Construction (IGLC) has been exploring new techniques for the industry. In this article the techniques developed for lean construction are compared with those of lean manufacturing. Differences between the manufacturing and the construction cases showed why lean production does not fully suit the construction industry. Although some elements are in an embryonic state, lean construction has built a set of techniques that are transferable to any constructor. Lean manufacturing and lean construction share many common elements despite their different techniques. The need for a joint combination of technical and human elements shows that both approaches conform to a common sociotechnological design. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - There have been many calls for the UK construction industry to improve its productivity and performance in order to exceed clients’ ever-growing expectations and needs (DTI, 2003). One obstacle to achieving the required improvement has been the construction industry’s reluctance to learn from other industries, hence causing time lags between the development of new technologies and management techniques, and their implementation within construction. Recent years have seen the wide acceptance of Total Quality Management and the emergence of Six Sigma in some industries. This paper examines the Six Sigma philosophy and investigates its potential application in construction by exploring the synergies that exists among Six Sigma, Total Quality Management (TQM), Lean Construction, and Sustainable Construction. © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of lean and partnering approaches to supply management in the construction industry. The paper outlines how the project environment that is endemic in the construction industry creates power regime structures that are often resistant to lean and partnering approaches to sourcing and business relationship management. Drawing on two case studies - one for mechanical and electrical products and the other for prefabricated restaurant subunits - the paper shows that what is appropriate in one context may not be an appropriate or realistic sourcing or business relationship choice in another. The paper concludes that only in supply chains with high levels of extended buyer dominance and/or interdependence, and with regular volumes, is a lean/partnering approach feasible. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper presents "work structuring," a term used to describe the effort of integrating product and process design throughout the project development process. To illustrate current work structuring practice, we describe a case study involving the installation of door frames into walls in a prison. We analyze why various problems existed. To improve the work structuring effort, we apply the "five whys" to develop local and global fixes for the system of precast walls and door frames. The five whys is a technique to elicit alternative ways of structuring work without being constrained by contractual agreements, traditions, or trade boundaries. We discuss the importance of dimensional tolerances in construction and how these affect the handoff of work from one group of workers to the next. We argue that these constraints and tolerance management practices are so embedded that project participants can miss opportunities to better integrate product and process design. We propose shifting the focus of work structuring from maximizing local trade efficiency to improving overall performance in the delivery system of a capital project.

AB  - Supply Chain Management (SCM) is about developing alliances with customers and suppliers to remove waste which in turn cuts costs, improves quality and provides customers with what they want and when they want it. This paper provides an overview of SCM. Based on identified theoretical advocated advantages, a rationale for deploying SCM is outlined.

AB  - Over the past 20 years or so Fordist production methods of car construction have by and large been replaced globally by the Japanese lean production system. Out of this has grown modularisation as platform engineering was adopted in the drive to control costs and yet maintain brand identities. Much of this was dependent upon mechanical technologies. More recently, as a consequence of developments in electronics, computer and communications technologies both within and without the automotive industry, the balance has shifted more towards the use of electronics in automobiles. This paper looks at possible developments in the use of telematics in cars and argues that the future lies increasingly in alliances between the auto producers and the electronics, computer hardware/software and communications industries. However, despite this there remains a degree of consumer resistance to paying for electronic devices and services, and it is suggested here that a considerable consumer education drive is required if the telematics revolution is to take place as forecast earlier.

AB  - Globalisation means enhanced competition. This is a problem both for firms in rich countries, and for those in developing countries. In particular producers in high-income countries are increasingly being threatened by imports from low wage economies. Lean production techniques are therefore an urgent prerequisite for producers everywhere. But how can the degree of progress in the adoption of lean production be measured? And what factors determine the rate of adoption of lean production? This paper addresses both methodological issues (the construction of a lean production index) and the analysis of factors determining its adoption through an investigation of the South African auto components sector. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In complex and concurrent construction projects, reliable planning becomes a centre for effective collaboration across upstream supply chains and downstream operations at the work face. Thousands of literatures in construction planning have been published over the past 50 years; introducing, testing, and implementing mountain of techniques and tools. However, they are very fragmented and have not yet provided a universal system that remedies a typical problem of separation of execution from planning. To solve this puzzle, this paper introduced a new methodology called 'multi-constraint planning', which possesses five superior characteristics including (1) collaborative and multi-level planning; (2) multi-constraint consideration; (3) effective uncertainty handling; (4) appropriate visual representation; and (5) practicable optimisation. An integrated decision support system that incorporates web-based and mobile information management system, 4D-visualisation system, and evolutionary optimisation system is successfully developed as an enabler for implementation of the proposed methodology. The two modules of information management and visualisation are detailed and demonstrated in the paper. It is envisaged that successful implementation of this system will enable generation of reliable plans and constraint-free execution assignments, in turn, reduce production risks and improve on-site productivity.

AB  - There has recently been considerable interest in construction research in paradigms developed for the manufacturing sector. Using lean thinking and agile production as examples of innovative organizational and business process design, this paper explores their commonalities and differences. In this way, it is possible to judge which paradigm is the most appropriate for given market conditions. By presenting action research outputs from a project on the UK house-building industry, the paper indicates the potential application of both lean and agile construction from a supply chain perspective. The paper concludes that house-building supply chains have to be engineered according to whether the market objectives are low cost, flexibility or a combination of the two.

AB  - New management thinking, like that of lean production, has suggested that better labor and cost performance can be achieved by improving the reliability of flows. In this context, lean thinking portrays reliable flows as the timely availability of resources, i.e., materials, information, and equipment. Little attention has been given to labor as a flow. Further, little discussion can be found related to flexible capacity management strategies. Efforts to utilize lean thinking in construction, so far, have generated limited evidence to support the need for more reliable labor flows. This paper investigates the lean principle that more reliable flows lead to better labor performance. Actual data from three bridge construction projects are examined to document the instances of poor flow (resource) reliability and its effect on labor performance. Inefficient labor hours are calculated. The results show that there is strong support that more reliable material, information, and equipment availability contributes to better performance. However, the projects showed considerable deficiencies in the utilization of the labor resource. It is concluded that lean improvement initiatives should focus more on workforce management strategies to improve labor utilization that will lead to better labor performance.

AB  - Identifying and removing constraints from bottleneck activities help to reduce uncertainties in construction processes and increases the transparency of project management. The present means of look-ahead planning do poorly in resolving hidden constraints in the supply chain and information flow. Accordingly, work plans are vulnerable to the uncertainties that result in flow variation. It has been realized that reducing and eliminating critical constraints through better means of look-ahead planning are the keys to achieving reliable workflow and, consequently, increased productivity. This paper presents a constraint-based planning tool, Integrated Production Scheduler (IPS), to enhance planning reliability while adopting lean construction principles and the theory of constraints. Unlike the critical path method, the IPS models two additional types of constraints related to resource supply and information exchange. It employs four activity buffers: working, shielding, pulling, and screening for managing critical constraints and shielding the production from uncertainties. The implementation of the IPS is prototyped as a distributed scheduling system using Internet technologies such as Java and XML. It facilitates setting up a transparent project management environment where faster communication and active collaboration among project members are achievable.

AB  - This paper presents issues critical to the development and successful implementation of computer simulation models for ship component manufacturing within a naval shipyard environment. More specifically, it addresses the need for a supply chain approach to developing simulation models for use as a management tool. The problem domain is the naval shipbuilding industry, which is different from industries associated with traditional manufacturing. Due to the tremendous number of components associated with naval warship construction and the extreme length of the build cycle, managing such an enterprise presents a formidable challenge. As Northrop Grumman Newport News strives to be a lean enterprise, managers will need new tools to address the lean initiatives of the many shops and construction areas within their domain. In this paper, it is suggested that the application of computer simulation using a component supply chain approach could provide management with a powerful tool to improve efficiency. A three-phased approach for the development of an enterprise supply chain model is presented. In the first phase, individual simulation models are developed for manufacturing and material support functions. The second phase addresses the linking of the models into small model networks. In the third phase, additional models are developed and more sophisticated networking strategies are utilized.

AB  - A statistical experiment limited by practical constraints may have to be conducted with less than the number of runs required in a regular orthogonal array. When this is anticipated, a design matrix which is a submatrix of an orthogonal array may be constructed in a way that still permits useful estimation of a reduced number of effects. In this paper, the procedure for this design construction is proposed for two-level experiments, taking into account both the feasibility and efficiency of the resulting design.

AB  - The new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter by Lockheed Martin engineers is manufactured with an advanced technology and lean manufacturing initiatives that have resulted in building a lethal and affordable fighter aircraft. CAD/CAM, simulation computer software, and Design-for-Manufacturing concepts have played a major role in its development. Lean-manufacturing initiatives have helped to reduce the manufacturing cost of the plane and design engineers can eliminate waste before construction begins. Some of the keys that have added towards providing quality for the plane include tight management over each plane version, mistake-proofing for assembly operations, and the use of cellular processes for providing speed, quality, and waste elimination. Common design features of the three F-35 versions provides a single assembly line that can meet affordability and quality goals and modular flexible tooling also provides a cost saving upto 30%.

AB  - The plans for the construction of pipelines in UK are reported. It is forecasted that the country will suffer a shortfall in gas supply by the middle of the decade. The race is on to build the pipeline infrastructure that will import European gas to meet the demand. Analysis shows that UK is infrastructure constrained and the long lead-time for building pipelines could mean that year 2005-2007 are lean years for UK gas consumers.

AB  - Reducing the lead time for engineered-to-order products can allow more time for exploration and testing of design alternatives, reduction of project durations, or some combination of both. Combined with improved reliability of work flow on site, more fabricated products can be pulled to site when needed, thus avoiding unnecessary inventories. Lead time reduction benefits both the design and the construction phases of projects, and it benefits the fabricator as well. Integration of engineering and detailing may offer the greatest potential for lead time reduction. However, fabrication lead times can also be reduced. This paper describes the application of lean production concepts and techniques to structural precast concrete fabrication. The key change was learning to identify and utilise work flow as opposed to focusing management effort on keeping workers and plant busy. Results included shop cycle time and lead time reduction, increased throughput rate, and improved productivity. © 2003, MCB UP Limited

Directly or indirectly they have pioneered approaches and principles such as, among many others, just in time, one-piece flow, and "andon." The Toyota Production System was the basis for "lean manufacturing." The purpose of lean manufacturing is to improve product cycle time, cost competitiveness, and quality by eliminating any waste in the manufacturing process through continuous improvement by a motivated workforce. The authors, as part of the NASSCO shipbuilding production system project, were responsible for introducing lean manufacturing to the project team and developing a "Guide to Lean Shipbuilding." This paper first discusses what lean manufacturing is, and then reports on a benchmarking visit to Japanese shipyards. Finally, a description of lean shipbuilding and its implementation is presented with case examples of lean workshops.

AB  - This paper proposes a knowledge management framework for project definition of capital facility projects. The conceptual framework emphasizes project-based learning and the creation of group knowledge in early phase project planning and design activity. The use of multi-disciplinary expertise in this phase of project development acknowledges the use of multiple decision frames by which stakeholders approach project solutions. This research views project definition as a collaborative decision-making process, and highlights the need for supporting group management techniques and technologies. Project definition is regarded as the phase of project development where exploration of alternatives creates innovative problem and solution definitions that allows maximum customer value generation to be developed. This paper proposes a management framework to support organizational and process interfaces within project definition. The model is based primarily on findings from recent research literature and on exploratory descriptive research. The model presents a process for project definition and supports group knowledge creation and management. The model bases its development on soft systems methodology to support group cognition, learning and creative solution generation. Collaborative group theory is incorporated into the model to support project definition. The framework builds on theoretical principles of lean design and construction.

AB  - Material waste has been recognized as a major problem in the construction industry that has important implications both for the efficiency industry and for the environmental impact of construction projects. Moreover, waste measurement plays an important role in the management of production systems since it is an effective way to assess their performance, allowing areas of potential improvement to be pointed out. This paper describes the main results of two research studies carried out in Brazil that investigated the occurrence of material waste at 74 building sites located in different regions of that country. Some typical figures for the waste of some key construction materials are provided, and the main causes of waste in the sector are discussed. The results indicate that the waste of materials in the Brazilian building industry is fairly high and that a large variability in waste incidence is found across different projects. Most of this waste can be avoided by implementing inexpensive preventive measures, mostly related to managerial improvements.

AB  - This paper presents initial findings of ongoing research that is developing a best practice framework for the Implementation of empowerment within construction organisations. Date obtained from 53 construction and manufacturing organisations are analysed. Findings confirm 62 empowerment activities, specifically, their respective influence at four organisational levels (strategic, general, operational, and direct work), and the roles of operatives and management, in effectively performing them. It s shown that almost all levels of an organisation have a significant contribution to play in efficiently performing empowerment activities, whilst senior management (at strategic, general, and operational levels) has greatest influence. The investigation also demonstrates that necessary resources and a suitable environment are crucial for successful empowerment implementation.

AB  - An improvement methodology is proposed for the design process in construction projects. Based on concepts and principles of lean production, the methodology considers the design process as a set of three different models - conversion, flow, and value. Four stages are necessary to produce improvements and changes - (1) diagnosis/evaluation; (2) changes implementation; (3) control; and (4) standardization. The methodology suggests the application of seven tools in accordance to specific needs (detected and desired) on five potential areas of improvement - client, administration, project, resources, and information. Results of an application included an increase of 31% in the share of value adding activities, 44% reduction of unit errors in the products, up to 58% decrease of waiting times in the process, and an expansion of the utilization in the cycle times. In this manner, not only did the efficiency and effectiveness of internal engineering products improve, but also the whole project, by improving one of the main suppliers of construction.

AB  - Variability is common on construction projects and must be managed effectively. New management thinking, like that of lean production, has suggested that better labor and cost performance can be achieved by reducing output variability. Efforts to utilize lean thinking in construction, so far, have generated limited evidence to support this claim. This paper investigates the relationship between variability and project performance to test the notion that reducing output variability will result in improved labor performance. Using productivity data from concrete formwork activities on multiple projects, various measures of output variability are tested against construction performance. It is shown that variability in output is inevitable and that there is little correlation between output variability and project performance, but that variability in labor productivity is closely correlated to project performance. It is concluded that lean improvement initiatives should be redirected to adaptable workforce management capabilities to reduce variability in labor productivity instead of output in order to improve project performance.

AB  - The Just-In-Time (JIT) philosophy holds tremendous potentials for improving the movement of precast concrete components from the prefabrication yard to, and within, the construction site. The space constraints for storage and the traffic congestion at the worksite can then be alleviated. Savings from the efficient management of precast concrete components can be used to offset the higher costs of procurement. By means of a survey, this paper examines if main contractors are ready to adopt the JIT philosophy to receiving and installing precast concrete components on site. Observations from the survey, however, suggest that JIT/lean operations need to work hand in hand with agile operations in the supply chain to cope with schedule fluctuations.

AB  - The latter part of the twentieth century saw the lean production paradigm positively impact many market sectors ranging from automotive through to construction. In particular there is much evidence to suggest that level scheduling combined with the elimination of muda has successfully delivered a wide range of products to those markets where cost is the primary order winning criteria. However, there are many other markets where the order winner is availability. This has led to the emergence of the agile paradigm typified by “quick response” and similar initiatives. Nevertheless, “lean” and “agile” are not mutually exclusive paradigms and may be married to advantage in a number of different ways. This paper explores ways in which hybrid strategies can be developed to create cost-effective supply chains and proposes an integrated manufacture/logistics model for enabling the essential infrastructure. © 2001, MCB UP Limited

AB  - Subcontractors and suppliers are playing an increasingly important role in project construction-it is not uncommon for as much as 90 per cent of a project to be undertaken by subcontractors. The result of this increased involvement is that main contractors are now concentrating their efforts on managing subcontractors rather than employing direct labour. Outlines an approach to partnering developed by a European conglomerate which is being employed throughout the UK. Commences with an overview of recent studies into the UK construction industry concentrating on partnering, quality and lean production. The second part discusses the context of these points from a quality, general and construction project management perspective. A form of benchmarking is described and the actual partnering approach is detailed. Finally, the paper identifies the main points relating to quality as perceived by the project participants, as well as some of the overall advantages of adopting this approach to partnering. © MCB University Press, 0265-671X.

AB  - Following the success of the Toyota Production System in the world of automotive manufacturing, the new business philosophy of the lean enterprise is gaining ground in that industry and in many others, among them construction; it appears to be positioned well to replace nearly a century of conventional or mass production practices. This study investigates the use of benchmarking in transforming a conventional organization into a lean enterprise. In this transformation, the management of knowledge and the practice of continuous learning and improvement figure prominently. From the perspective of benchmarking as a learning tool designed to reduce uncertainty in the organizational environment by reference to peer experience, the study distinguishes various forms of benchmarking and then addresses issues in knowledge management, information seeking and use, the diffusion of innovations, resistance to change, benchmarking strategies and practices, and benchmarking teams and protocols, concluding with a critique of its limitations.

AB  - A database program called WorkPlan has been created to systematically develop weekly work plans. Such work plans are used by crew foremen in scheduling work packages and allocating available labor and equipment resources. WorkPlan adopts the Last Planner methodology, which implements several lean construction techniques. A week prior to conducting work, WorkPlan guides the user step by step through the process of spelling out work packages, identifying constraints, checking constraint satisfaction, releasing work packages, and allocating resources; then at the end of the week, collecting field progress data and reasons for plan failure. This systematic approach helps the user create quality work plans and learn from understanding reasons for failure. The lean planning philosophy underlying WorkPlan and the functionality of the computer program implementation are detailed in this paper. Various ways of displaying work package data are illustrated. WorkPlan's job-shop scheduling view complements the view traditionally adopted by project management, as is reflected in scheduling tools using the critical-path method.

AB  - Experiments are carried out to examine the ferrite formation in four lean construction steels of low carbon and low alloy contents during continuous cooling. The variation of the heat capacity during the transformation is measured by means of differential thermal analysis, and the heat capacity is converted to the volume fraction ferrite as a function of temperature. The ferrite growth is modelled in two ways: (i) according to an interface mobility model, and (ii) according to a diffusion control model. Different assumptions are made to model the geometry of the microstructure. It is shown that the interface mobility model, applying the proper driving force and geometry, can account for the experimental ferrite growth at the early stage of transformation, but carbon diffusion has to be taken into account quantitatively when the carbon concentration profile becomes significant. The simulation according to the diffusion control model is performed using the Dictra program based on the local equilibrium hypothesis. The resulting discrepancies with the experiments are partially due to the simple spherical geometry that is assumed.

AB  - Many construction processes include installation of unique materials in specific locations in the facility being built; materials and locations must match before installation can take place. Mismatches due to delay and uncertainty in supplying materials or completing prerequisite work at those locations hamper field productivity. This is illustrated here using a model of a materials-management process with a matching problem that typifies fast-track process-plant projects. The uniqueness of materials and locations combined with the unpredictability in duration and variation in execution quality of various steps in the supply chain allow for different ways to sequence material delivery and work area completion. Several alternatives are described. Their impact on process execution is illustrated by means of probabilistic process models. One model reflects a total lack of coordination between delivery and work area completion prior to the start of construction; a second one describes perfect coordination. The corresponding materials staging buffers and construction progress are plotted based on output from discrete-event simulation models. A third probabilistic model then illustrates the use of the lean construction technique known as pull-driven scheduling. Real-time feedback regarding the status of progress on site is provided to the fabricator off site so process steps can be resequenced opportunistically. This yields smaller buffers, earlier project completion, and, when properly accounted for, increased productivity.

AB  - In this paper we use the concept of 'learning capability' to integrate several frameworks regarding the changing nature of industrial organization and international competition. In doing so, we emphasize the primacy of learning and learning capability in the post-Fordist world of internatinal competition, with a focus on analyzing Fordist and post-Fordist forms of learning at various levels and their differing impact on the learning capability of firms in a regional context. First, we examine the organizational arrangements that promote individual and organizational learning within the firm, with special reference to the Japanese practices of lean and flexible production. Second, we introduce the concept of transactional learning to delineate various forms of Fordist and post-Fordist learning that occur in the marketplace. After reinterpreting Porter's (1990) diamond model as a market structure for transactional learning, we extend his work by emphasizing the role of interfirm networks in facilitating learning and learning capability. The focus of this analysis is on the importance of trust and reciprocity in maintaining effective information flow and cooperation within these networks. In doing so, we discuss differences in the social construction of trust and networks and their corresponding impact on dominant forms of learning and learning capability. We further introduce the concept of spatial learning for analyzing the role of industrial districts as learning agents. We conclude the paper with an examination of the concept of learning infrastructure as a general construct for policymaking regarding regional development and international competition in the post-Fordist age.

AB  - The paper discusses the application of business process re-engineering (BPR) to the construction industry. In this context, the paper will examine the concepts of computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) and lean production, and question the relevance of these techniques to construction. The objective of the paper is to show that construction can, and should, be viewed as a manufacturing process. Much of the discussion is derived from the author's work on the Eureka CIMsteel Project - a Pan-European research project concerned with the application of computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) technology to the European constructional steelwork industry. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Since at least the Tavistock studies, the need to improve communication and coordination in the construction process has been stressed. This paper reports from a study of 25 construction projects where QA and a number of procedures were in use which might have been expected to bring such improvement. The finding was, however, that coordination was poor. The purpose of the paper is to consider how this finding is to be explained. With reference to the markets/hierarchy theoretical framework, it is proposed that the use of this and other similar frameworks in fact obscures the empirical reality which they are intended to explain. It is accepted that the meta-language which such frameworks supply may enable researchers and those prac-titioners who choose to use this language to share their interests and concerns. However, the relationship between the abstract and global concepts which feature in such talk and the reality to which they refer needs closer enquiry. This paper proposes that our knowledge of the impact of QA has been compromised by the lack of such attention. The paper then inspects the global proposition that QA has been a step in the right direction towards TQM. With the aim of giving this proposition a stronger empirical referent, six key principles of TQM are used as a benchmark against which to assess the significance of the empirical data drawn from the study. It is proposed that greater attention to such data is necessary to provide a sounder basis for establishing what needs to be done to stimulate change.

AB  - The early work in project management introduced project-oriented systems and methodologies, previously lacking in the project direct participants. The emphasis inevitably was on centralised project teams owning the systems. The paper illustrates through case studies the developed concept of lean project management, which recognises that the system and philosophy is now better understood by participants, who themselves provide and contribute to the project control mechanisms. The project manager becomes an individual client-based leader of the project team, the source of decision making and the conduit for communication. The approach has been successful on complex public arts buildings over 10 years and could be of general application in a wide range of project management and management by project environments.
